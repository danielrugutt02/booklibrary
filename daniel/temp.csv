How many of us can even identify the basic parts of the brain and when they mature? <P>After reading this book, you'll be able to identify the basic parts of the brain.

Developments in brain research have already provided scientific support for educational practices such as cooperative learning, and new developments will almost certainly influence other aspects of teaching and learning, from the content of the curriculum to the layout of the classroom. The question we must ask ourselves now, says Sylwester, is whether the education profession as a whole can continue to ignore the significant role that brain research can play in improving teaching and learning. - from Amzon","Medical Books, Science & Technology, Education",,,,,,,QP360.5.S96 1995

In addition, it establishes a basis for comparing political systems in terms of their public policies rather than their institutions or political processes. The book begins by placing in a historical perspective the worldwide role of the state as a major provider of goods and services. Following this general background is an 'accounting scheme' that brings some semblance of order to the seemingly infinite variety of policy-relevant variables and makes the comparative study of public policy more manageable. It is suggested that any nation's public policies can be explained in terms of situational, structural, environmental and cultural factors. The second part of the book applies the accounting scheme to an increasingly specific and narrow range of public policies. The author examines one crucial area of public policy - health care - and the evolution of that policy in four diverse nations: Germany, Great Britain, the Soviet Union and Japan. The book concludes with an assessment of the prospects for an American national health care programme in the light of the experiences of these other nations. - from Amzon",,,,,,,,H61.L42 1979

As their power increased, they became defenders of the racial, political, social, and economic status quo. By the beginning of this century, however, a feisty tradition of dissent began to appear in Southern Baptist life as criticism of the center increased from both the left and the right. The popular belief in a doctrine of ""once saved, always saved"" led progressive Baptists to claim that moderates, once saved, did not address the serious social and political problems that faced many in the South. These Baptist dissenters claimed that they could not be ""at ease in Zion.""<br><br>Led by the radical Walter Nathan Johnson in the 1920s and 1930s, progressive Baptists produced civil rights advocates, labor organizers, women's rights advocates, and proponents of disarmament and abolition of capital punishment. They challenged some of the most fundamental aspects of southern society and of Baptist ecclesiastical structure and practice. For their efforts and beliefs, many of these men and women suffered as they lost jobs, experienced physical danger and injury, and endured character assassination.<br><br>In <I>A Genealogy of Dissent</I>, David Stricklin traces the history of these progressive Baptists and their descendants throughout the twentieth century and shows how they created an active culture of protest within a highly traditional society. - from Amzon","Church History, Baptist, History, Christianity, General, History",,,,,,,"BX6462.3.S77

On her second journey, she ventured into remote parts of Gabon and the French Congo--the first European to do so. She encountered cannibals and crocodiles, studied the religious customs of the reclusive Fang tribe, climbed Mount Cameroon and explored the Ogowe River, trading cloth for ivory and rubber to fund her trip. She returned only once to Africa, during the Boer War, when she worked as a nurse and journalist. Tragically, she died of typhoid in 1900, only 38 years old.</div></div> - from Amzon","Women, Travelers & Explorers, General",,,,,,,"DT476.23.K56F72

Drawing on her countless conversations with the artist, Ashton deftly explores Rothko’s personal sense of commitment and mission, his love of music and literature, and his philosophical outlook, particularly his interest in Nietzsche. She examines his associations with other artists -- Max Weber, Milton Avery, Adolph Gottlieb, Philip Guston, Robert Motherwell and others -- as well as his relationships with artists and connoisseurs in other countries. The many illustrations -- 16 in color and 30 in black and white -- represent the whole spectrum of Rothko’s work and further enhance this valuable study. American art historian and critic Dore (pronounced DOR-ee) Ashton (1928-2017) wrote some of the earliest and most insightful histories of Abstract Expressionism and the leading painters of the New York School. A tireless champion of new art, Ms. Ashton ran afoul of John Canaday, a staunch anti-Modernist who became the The New York Times’s art news editor and chief critic in 1959. In a blistering memo, he accused her of writing to an artistic clique and cheerleading for it. Her retort, placed on Canaday’s desk, was a diatribe, reviling her boss with references to Zenocrates and Zola, and throwing back at him his own published words. A bitter battle ensued and Ashton left the newspaper in November 1960. Enlisting the support of fellow critics, including Harold Rosenberg, Meyer Schapiro, and Leo Steinberg, she succeeded in putting the matter before the International Association of Art Critics, which censured Canaday for “infringing basic principles of freedom of criticism.” After leaving The Times, Ashton, who lived in Manhattan, taught art history at the School of Visual Arts, Cooper Union, and the New School, while generating a stream of articles, exhibition catalogs, monographs, and biographies. - from Amzon","Individual Artists, History",,,,,,,"ND237.R725A93

The very mention of the word strikes fear in the hearts of many teachers and school leaders, leading to confusion and panic rather than improved student achievement. Author Douglas B. Reeves explains how to transform accountability from destructive and demoralizing accounting drills into a constructive decision-making process that improves teaching, learning, and leadership. Reeves encourages educators to become proactive in developing student-centered accountability systems. These systems capture the many aspects of teaching that test scores don’t reveal-they tell the stories behind the numbers. Reeves shows how educators can create accountability systems that enhance teacher motivation and lead to significant improvements in student achievement and equity, even in traditionally low-performing schools.<P>Accountability for Learning explains how to build a student-centered accountability system by examining key indicators in teaching, leadership, curriculum, and parent and community involvement. Focusing on the classroom, it outlines how teachers can become leaders in accountability by using a four-step process of observation, reflection, synthesis, and replication of effective teaching practices. Finally, the author discusses the role of local, state, and federal policymakers and corrects the myths associated with No Child Left Behind.<P>""As educators, we have two choices,"" Reeves says. ""We can rail against the system, hoping that standards and testing are a passing fad, or we can lead the way in a fundamental reformulation of educational accountability."" <i>Accountability for Learning</i> gives readers the helping hand they need to lead the way to fair and comprehensive accountability.<P><b>Douglas B. Reeves</b> leads the Center for Performance Assessment, an international organization dedicated to improving student achievement and educational equity. He is the author of 17 books, including the best-selling <i>Making Standards Work</i>. - from Amzon","Administration, Reform & Policy, Instruction Methods, Administration",,,,,,,LB2806.22.R44

Bruner,,,,Harvard University Press,,1986,,,,,NON FICTION,,Book,"<p>In this characteristically graceful and provocative book, Jerome Bruner, one of the principal architects of the cognitive revolution, sets forth nothing less than a new agenda for the study of mind. According to Professor Bruner, cognitive science has set its sights too narrowly on the logical, systematic aspects of mental life--those thought processes we use to solve puzzles, test hypotheses, and advance explanations. There is obviously another side to the mind--a side devoted to the irrepressibly human acts of imagination that allow us to make experience meaningful. This is the side of the mind that leads to good stories, gripping drama, primitive myths and rituals, and plausible historical accounts. Bruner calls it the ""narrative mode,"" and his book makes important advances in the effort to unravel its nature.</p><p>Drawing on recent work in literary theory, linguistics, and symbolic anthropology, as well as cognitive and developmental psychology Professor Bruner examines the mental acts that enter into the imaginative creation of possible worlds, and he shows how the activity of imaginary world making undergirds human science, literature, and philosophy, as well as everyday thinking, and even our sense of self.</p><p>Over twenty years ago, Jerome Bruner first sketched his ideas about the mind's other side in his justly admired book <i>On Knowing: Essays for the Left Hand</i>. <i>Actual Minds, Possible Worlds</i> can be read as a sequel to this earlier work, but it is a sequel that goes well beyond its predecessor by providing rich examples of just how the mind's narrative mode can be successfully studied. The collective force of these examples points the way toward a more humane and subtle approach to the investigation of how the mind works.</p> - from Amzon","Psychology & Counseling, Cognitive Psychology, Cognitive, General, Philosophy, Philosophy, Cognitive Psychology",,,,,,,"BF38.B75

Indeed, the reactions to the book now constitute a considerable secondary literature themselves.  In the long-awaited second edition of this book, George Steiner offers a complete revision, an updated bibliography, and a new preface in which he places his groundbreaking work in the present context of poetics, hermeneutics, and translation studies.<br>        In the previous edition, Steiner provided readers with the first systematic investigation since the eighteenth century of the phenomenology and processes of translation both inside and between languages. Taking issue with the principal emphasis of modern linguistics, he finds the root of the ""Babel problem"" in our deep instinct for privacy and territory, noting that every people has in its language a unique body of shared secrecy.  With this provocative thesis he analyzes every aspect of translation from fundamental conditions of interpretation to the most intricate of linguistic constructions.<br>        Like the towering figures of Derrida, Lacan, and Foucault, Steiner's work is central to current literary thought. <em>After Babel</em> is essential reading for anyone hoping to understand the debates raging in the academy today. - from Amzon","Linguistics, Translating, Linguistics",,,,,,,"PE501.S693

REVIEW:I learned about lots of new birds. Mostly the different kinds that I run across where I might travel or be. This is a great for few reasons;

1, It's broken down into catagory by bird type: ex: waterfowl, land, flight, etc.
2. It's filled with beautiful, colorful portraits of each of the birds. Great for the more the visually-learning type.
3. There are little maps of the United States for each section that displays darken areas for the bird population.
4. At the back of the book is a check-list for each bird in the book.

So there you have it. It's worth looking at, and if you enjoy learning about wildlife, or like to just learn about birds. Then I recommend this. - from Amzon","Reference, Reference",,,,,,,"QL681.G77

In typical fashion, he responded to the birth of his son by forming a mediocre rock band and taking it on tour. Now, in <i>Alternadad</i>, he tells the hilarious and poignant story of how he learned to be a father to his son, Elijah, after the failure of his short-lived rock ’n’ roll dreams.<br><br>Pollack and his wife, Regina, were determined to raise their son without growing up too much themselves. They welcomed the responsibility but were worried that they’d become uptight and out of touch. Through the ups and downs of the first years of their son’s life their determination is put to the test, and   they find themselves changing in ways they never expected, particularly after Elijah develops a biting problem in preschool.<br><br><i>Alternadad </i>is a refreshingly honest book about the wonders, terrors, and idiocies of parenting today. From enrolling his son in an absurd corporate gymnastics class to a disastrous visit to a rock festival to uncomfortable encounters with other parents whom he’d ordinarily avoid, Pollack candidly explores the everyday struggles and the long-term compromises that come with parenthood.<br><br>Mixing ironic skepticism with an appreciation for the absurdities of everyday life, <i>Alternadad</i> is a portrait of a new version of the American family: responsible if unorthodox parents raising kids who know the difference between the Ramones and the Sex Pistols.

Rodriguez's eloquent, impassioned, frighteningly vivid chronicle of his youth in Los Angeles in the late 60s and early 70s. Growing up in Watts and East L.A., Rodriguez joined his first gang at age 11 and was drawn into ""la vida loca"" - the crazy life. Gangs were ""how we wove something out of the threads of nothing, "" he remembers. By age 18, he was a veteran of gang warfare, police killings, drug overdoses, and suicides that had claimed 25 of his friends and had driven him and so many others to despair.

They were only woven into this astonishing book years later, when his son, Ramiro, joined a gang in Chicago where they now live. Always Running is packed with episode after episode of high drama, but within this honest and powerful depiction of social devastation, there is a father's impassioned message of understanding and hope to his son, and to thousands like him.

Writing about changes in the notion of womanhood, Denise Riley examines, in the manner of Foucault, shifting historical constructions of the category of ""women"" in relation to other categories central to concepts of personhood: the soul, the mind, the body, nature, the social. Feminist movements, Riley argues, have had no choice but to play out this indeterminacy of women. This is made plain in their oscillations, since the 1790s, between concepts of equality and of difference.

In large part, we have thrown out the antiquated notions of the 1800s, giving way to a more realistic, sociocultural view of the world. The United States is, perhaps more than any other industrialized country, distinguished by the size and diversity of its racial and ethnic minority populations. Current trends promise that these features will endure. Fifty years from now, there will most likely be no single majority group in the United States.

This volume presents the most up-to-date findings and analysis on racial and social dynamics, with recommendations for ongoing research. It examines compelling issues in the field of race relations, including:<br> <br></p> <ul> <li>Race and ethnicity in criminal justice.</li> <li>Demographic and social trends for Hispanics, Asian Americans, and Native Americans.</li> <li>Trends in minority-owned businesses.</li> <li>Wealth, welfare, and racial stratification.</li> <li>Residential segregation and the meaning of ""neighborhood.""</li> <li>Disparities in educational test scores among races and ethnicities.</li> <li>Health and development for minority children, adolescents, and adults.</li> <li>Race and ethnicity in the labor market, including the role of minorities in America's military.</li> <li>Immigration and the dynamics of race and ethnicity.</li> <li>The changing meaning of race.</li> <li>Changing racial attitudes.<br></li> </ul> <p><br> This collection of papers, compiled and edited by distinguished leaders in the behavioral and social sciences, represents the most current literature in the field.

important as eating breakfast and as natural as brushing their teeth. For
nearly fifty years an entire nation turned to this quick-witted, worldly-
wise counselor for advice on everything from proper dinner etiquette to
sex, yet few actually knew the real woman behind the byline. Award–winning
journalist Rick Kogan was Ann Landers's last editor and close friend, and
in America's Mom he paints an intimate, affectionate, knowing, and deeply
honest portrait of a remarkable woman whose real life story rivaled
anything that appeared in the millions of letters she received and
responded to during her long career. Iowa-born Eppie Lederer was first
hired by the Chicago Sun-Times to take over the daily advice column in 1955
-- and over the next half-century she helped shape the nation's social and
sexual landscape. Already a fiercely independent housewife and political
activist, she reinvented herself as ""Ann Landers,"" went on to become
America's beloved ""surrogate mother,"" and was one of the country's most
influential women. The friend and confidante of celebrities, journalists,
and politicians, she composed columns that touched the lives of so many --
even as her own life was shaken by dramatic, often heartbreaking events.
Written with the enthusiastic support and coop-eration of Ann Landers's
colleagues, admirers, and friends, Kogan's unforgettable memoir is a
fascinating, full-bodied account of the triumphs, the wisdom, the courage,
and the many trials of one of the twentieth century's most enduring icons
-- her painful lifelong feud with her identical twin sister, ""Dear Abby"";
her outspokenness and stubborn refusal to shy away from even the most
controversial topics; and the tragic breakup of her own thirty-six-year
marriage when her husband abandoned her for another woman, an event that
she bravely and openly shared with her millions of sympathetic fans. Here,
too, is a wealth of touching, enlightening, and remarkable true stories
shared by people from all walks of life who were profoundly affected by the
good sense and guidance of Ann Landers. America's Mom is a moving tribute
to a singular woman who has earned an eternal place in our culture . . .
and our hearts.","Actors & Entertainers, Journalists, Women, Humor & Entertainment",,,,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4zfpwAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"PN4874.L23K64

This two-part volume examines and compares educational systems in their national contexts. Part 1 is a blend of historical, philosophical, political, and sociological perspectives on a variety of foundational topics in international education, including the vital interests of developing and developed nation-states; the implications of ethnonationalism; political, economic, environmental, and educational relationships; transnational issues in a global society; and citizenship education. Part 2 first scrutinizes the concept of comparative education and then explores the essential elements of education in the U.S.--a sturdy departure point for analyses and comparisons of the national contexts and education in eight representative countries: the United Kingdom, France, Russia, Mexico, Japan, China, India, and Nigeria. UNESCO states that education for all is one of the biggest moral challenges of our times. One step toward propagating the universal right to education is making a conscious effort to understand the educational systems of other nations. New to this edition are chapters on France and India, with their enduring cultures and world presence. Each chapter in the book concludes with discussion questions, research topics, and suggestions for further reading.<p> Titles of related interest from Waveland Press: Gutek, <i>American Education 1945-2000: A History and Commentary</i> (ISBN 9781577661009); Gutek, <i>A History of the Western Educational Experience,</i> Second Edition (ISBN 9780881338188); and Gutek, <i>An Historical Introduction to American Education,</i> Third Edition (ISBN 9781577667520). - from Amzon","Philosophy & Social Aspects, Educational Philosophy",,,,,,,LC191.4.G684

Authors Silver and Miller demonstrate the complexity and diversity of these languages while dispelling popular misconceptions.  Their text reveals the linguistic richness of languages found throughout the Americas, emphasizing those located in the western United States and Mexico, while drawing on a wide range of other examples found from Canada to the Andes.  It introduces readers to such varied aspects of communicating as directionals and counting systems, storytelling, expressive speech, Mexican Kickapoo whistle speech, and Plains sign language.         The authors have included basics of grammar and historical linguistics, while emphasizing such issues as speech genres and other sociolinguistic issues and the relation between language and worldview.  They have incorporated a variety of data that have rarely or never received attention in nontechnical literature in order to underscore the linguistic diversity of the Americas, and have provided more extensive language classification lists than are found in most other texts.       <I>American Indian Languages: Cultural and Social Contexts</I> is a comprehensive resource that will serve as a text in undergraduate and lower-level graduate courses on Native American languages and provide a useful reference for students of American Indian literature or  general linguistics.

Drawing on the disciplines of political science, history, law, and anthropology and written in a direct, readable style, <I>American Indian Tribal Governments </I>is a comprehensive introduction to traditional tribal governments, to the history of Indian-white relations, to the structure and legal rights of modern tribal governments, and to the changing roles of federal and state governments in relation to modem tribal governments. Publication of this book fills a gap in American Indian studies, providing scholars with a basis from which to begin an integrated study of tribal government, providing teachers with an excellent introductory textbook, and providing general readers with an accessible and complete introduction to American Indian history and government.</p><p> The book's unique structure allows coverage of a great breadth of information while avoiding the common mistake of generalizing about all tribes and cultures. An introductory section presents the basic themes of the book and describes the traditional governments of five tribes chosen for their geographic and cultural diversity-the Senecas, the Muscogees, the Lakotas, the Isleta Pueblo, and the Yakimas. The next three chapters review the history of Indian-white relations from the time Christopher Columbus ""discovered"" America to the present. Then the history and modem government of each of the five tribes presented earlier is examined in detail. The final chapters analyze the evolution and current legal powers of tribal governments, the tribal-federal relationship, and the tribal-state relationship.</p><p><I>American Indian Tribal Governments </I>illuminates issues of tribal sovereignty<I> </I>and shows how tribes are protecting<I> </I>and expanding their control of tribal<I> </I>membership, legal systems, child welfare,<I> </I>land and resource use, hunting<I> </I>and fishing, business regulation, education,<I> </I>and social services.

Compounding their confusion is the highly publicized struggle of the contemporary Indian for self-determination, lost land, cultural preservation, and fundamental human rights—a struggle dramatized both by public acts of protest and by precedent-setting legal actions. More and more, the battles of American Indians are fought—and won—in the political arena and the courts.</p><p><cite>American Indians, American Justice</cite> explores the complexities of the present Indian situation, particularly with regard to legal and political rights. It is the first book to present an overview of federal Indian law in language readably accessible to the layperson. Remarkably comprehensive, it is destined to become a standard sourcebook for all concerned with the plight of the contemporary Indian.</p><p>Beginning with an examination of the historical relationship of Indians and the courts, the authors describe how tribal courts developed and operate today, and how they relate to federal and state governments. They define such key legal concepts as tribal sovereignty and Indian Country. By comparing and contrasting the workings of Indian and non-Indian legal institutions, the authors illustrate how Indian tribes have adapted their customs, values, and institutions to the demands of the modern world. Describing the activities of attorneys and Indian advocates in asserting and defending Indian rights, they identify the difficulties typically faced by Indians in the criminal and civil legal arenas and explore the public policy and legal rights of Indians as regards citizenship, voting rights, religious freedom, and basic governmental services.</p> - from Amzon","Native American, United States, Civil Procedure, Native American Studies, Specialty Boutique, United States, Native American Studies, Civil Procedure",,,,,,,"KF8224.C6D44

Prosperity in turn requires voluntary exchange of goods in a peaceful, well-ordered market. How to establish and maintain such markets? For Smith the answer lay in man's social instincts, which government may encourage by upholding social standards of decency, honesty, and virtue, but which government undermines when it unduly interferes with the intrinsically private functions of production and exchange.</div> - from Amzon","Economic History, Science & Math, Economics, Science & Mathematics",,,,,,,"AC7.559

This text provides a breadth-first overview of the central topics studied in the field: algorithms, hardware design, computer organization, system software, language models, programming, compilation, theory of computation, applications, networks, artificial intelligence, and the impact of computers on society. The authors present these topics in the context of the big picture, using a six-layer hierarchy of abstractions. The hierarchy is based on the algorithmic foundations of computer science and works upward from low-level hardware concepts through virtual machine environments, languages, software, and applications programs to the social issues raised by computer technology. Each layer in the hierarchy builds on ideas and concepts presented earlier. An accompanying lab manual provides exploratory lab activities. For this Java Version, Chapters 7 (Introduction to High-Level Language Programming) and 8 (The Tower of Babel) have been thoroughly revised to incorporate Java 2 as the programming language of implementation. - from Amzon","Computer Science, Networking & Cloud Computing, Programming, Software, Java, Computer Science",,,,,,,"QA76.S3596

allegories. Its account of a group of barnyard animals who revolt against
their vicious human master, only to submit to a tyranny erected by their
own kind, can fairly be said to have become a universal drama. Orwell is
one of the very few modern satirists comparable to Jonathan Swift in power,
artistry, and moral authority; in animal farm his spare prose and the logic
of his dark comedy brilliantly highlight his stark message. Taking as his
starting point the betrayed promise of the Russian Revolution, Orwell lays
out a vision that, in its bitter wisdom, gives us the clearest
understanding we possess of the possible consequences of our social and
political acts.","Satire, Classics, Contemporary, Literary",,,,,,,"PR6029.R8A725,1984"

The central part of the book is a bestiary of both real and mythological creatures, looking at the associations of each one in different cultures at different periods, and relating mythical and symbolic meanings to known biological and ecological facts.

Today, her reputation is tangled up with that of Sylvia Plath, whom she knew, and tainted with images of monster or victim. This biography, written with the full co-operation of Sexton's family and her principal psychiatrist who released three years of audiotaped therapy sessions, reveals and pivots around the creative relationship Anne Sexton struck with an incurable illness. Suffering from a mental disorder that eluded diagnosis, Anne Sexton underwent intensive psychotherapy and repeated bouts in mental institutions for nearly half her life. By the time she died, misery had hollowed her out, and drinking and pills had impaired her creativity. But hers had been an urgent, exciting and shocking new voice in poetry - accessible, moving, intensely honest; ""madness"" and its cultural meanings were central in her art. - from Amzon","Authors, United States, Women, History, Movements & Periods",,,,,,,PS3537.E915Z775 1991

This textbook is a result of that endeavor. When I took this course many, many, years ago, the primary references were the two volumes of P. M. Morse and H.

The new edition features a CD-ROM with the data sets and many new exercises.

A vast network of house churches had spring up-seemingly spontaneously-with converted Jews, clearly part of the 144,000 witnesses, taking leadership positions.  They taught their charges daily, based on the cyberspace sermons and lessons from the prolific Tsion Ben-Judah.  Tens of thousands of such clandestine local house churches, their very existence flying the face of the all-inclusive Enigma Babylon One world Faith, saw courageous converts added to the church every day...
 
In the most explosive episode yet in the continuing drama of those left behind, the Tribulation Force hurtles toward the four murders foretold in prophecy.  Antichrist himself is prophesied to suffer a lethal head wound.  As a supernatural horde of 200 million demonic horsemen slays a third of the remaining population, the Tribultion Force prepares for a future as fugitives.

Unique features of <em>Assessment in  Science</em> include: 1) practical strategies and tools for implementing  successful professional development programs in science assessment, 2)  teacher stories and case studies about classroom-based assessment  practice and how these teachers changed their assessment practice, 3)  examples of classroom-based assessments and scoring guides, 4) samples  of student work with teacher commentary, and 5) examples of how the  national reform documents in science education served as tools in  professional development programs and in designing classroom-based  assessments. <br />  <em>Assessment in Science</em> expands the existing literature on science  assessment by sharing a model for professional development, and  examples of teacher-developed assessments with accompanying student  work and teacher commentary. Chapters written by science teachers tell  how they assess students and how they have changed their assessment  practice, as well as how changing assessment practice has resulted in  a change in their science instruction. <br />  <em>Assessment in Science</em> is targeted at practising professionals in  science education: administrators, staff developers, science teachers,  and university science educators. <em>Assessment in Science</em> has  applicability to graduate-level courses in science education and  in-service courses for science teachers.

During the past decade, however, researchers have become convinced that ADHD is <em>not</em> always outgrown with age. Instead, they insist, it very often persists in later life and is a <em>common</em> psychiatric disorder in adults.<br> Paul H. Wender, who has been studying and writing about this disorder for more than 25 years, is the ideal candidate to sort out the current controversy surrounding the often undiagnosed ailment. When Wender's acclaimed <em>The Hyperactive Child, Adolescent, and Adult</em>, directed at both lay readers and clinicians, was published in 1987, the <em>American Journal of Psychiatry</em> greeted it as ""very clearly written and free of technical jargon,"" and declared that it ""should be in the personal library of every clinician of any discipline who deals with children with attention deficit disorder, adolescents, or adults on a regular basis."" Now, in <em>Attention-deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Adults</em>, Wender for the first time gathers together the important new breakthroughs he and others have made in the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in adults. Written for psychiatrists and non-medical therapists, but also of interest to the lay reader, the book emphasizes the commonalities that emerge from the research literature and winnows the factual from the sensational or overly simplistic reports in the popular media. Wender points to possible relationships between ADHD in adults and other psychiatric disorders, and discusses the impact of the disorder which can produce marital discord, academic failure, and disrupted careers.<br> Reviewing what we know about ADHD, its symptoms, its life course, its etiology, the usefulness of various drug treatments, and the value to the patient of education about the disorder, Wender brings together a wealth of information not available in any other volume. A clinician who has treated patients with ADHD for many years, he offers compelling firsthand accounts from men and women who offer dramatic insight into what it feels like to have ADHD and how it responds to medical treatment. Combining the insights of his clinical practice with his innovative research on pharmacological treatments of psychiatric disorders, Wender builds a powerful case that ADHD in adults is a common genetically transmitted disorder. However, he also offers evidence that drug treatments can dramatically reduce symptoms and, when necessary, render patients more amenable to treatment for any residual psychological symptoms. Further progress, Wender maintains, requires that more precise clinical trials go hand in hand with molecular genetic research.<br> Destined to become a classic in the field, <em>Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Adults</em> is an indispensable guide for clinicians and family counselors, and a source of help, hope, and understanding for adults who suspect that they or someone they care about may suffer from this much misunderstood disorder. - from Amzon","Attention Deficit & Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorders, Learning Disorders, Hyperactivity, Anatomy, Psychiatry, Child Psychology, Mental Illness, Pathologies, Anatomy, Psychiatry, Psychotherapy, Psychopathology",,,,,,,RC394.A85W46

Gives classroom teachers alternative ways of assessing how their learners think, what they know, and what they can do. Presents ways to measure collaborative skills and academic motivation since research in the “New Synthesis” tradition underscores the importance of cooperative learning as a key to both learning and motivation.

Now, in his most stimulating and persuasive book to date, the bestselling author of <I>Learned Optimism</I> introduces the revolutionary, scientifically based idea of ""Positive Psychology."" Positive Psychology focuses on strengths rather than weaknesses, asserting that happiness is not the result of  good genes or luck. Seligman teaches readers that happiness can be cultivated by identifying and using many of the strengths and traits that they already possess -- including kindness, originality, humor, optimism, and generosity. By frequently calling upon their ""signature strengths"" in all the crucial realms of life, readers will not only develop natural buffers against misfortune and the experience of negative emotion, they will move their lives up to a new, more positive plane. <P> Drawing on groundbreaking psychological research, Seligman shows how Positive Psychology is shifting the profession's paradigm away from its narrow-minded focus on pathology, victimology, and mental illness to positive emotion, virtue and strength, and positive institutions. Our signature strengths can be nurtured throughout our lives, with benefits to our health, relationships, and careers. <P> Seligman provides the Signature Strengths Survey along with a variety of brief tests that can be used to measure how much positive emotion readers experience, in order to help determine what their highest strengths are. The life-changing lesson of Authentic Happiness is that by identifying the very best in ourselves, we can improve the world around us and achieve new and sustainable levels of authentic contentment, gratification, and meaning. - from Amzon","Happiness, Emotions, Psychology & Counseling, Cognitive Psychology",,,,,,,"BF575.H27.F45

Believing Is Seeing is a work of multicultural scope and glittering intelligence that bridges the gulf between classical Japanese painting and the films of Spike Lee, between high theory and pop culture. Probing beyond the rhetorical surface of standard art histories and drawing on a panoramic array of illustrative material, Mary Anne Staniszewski throws a fresh light on individual works and the often mystifying criteria by which they are valued. - from Amzon","Criticism, History, Aesthetics",,,,,,,"N205.S72

Indeed, despite the fact that R. T. Williams popularized the notion, he was among the first to caution that it was not possible to predict the biological activities of the resulting metabolites. It has become increasingly apparent in recent years that not only do many metabolites of drugs and other chemicals display biological activity but also in many instances these metabolites play an important role in initiating several forms of cancer and are the cause of a variety of types of toxicity. Thus it seems appropriate to collect in one volume a series of reports outlining advances in the study of the formation of chemically active intermediary metabolic products of chemicals, mechanisms of toxicity or carcinogenesis, and pathways for true detoxication of these chemicals. The work of R. T. Williams, beginning in the late 1920s and early 1930s, marked the first concerted effort to understand the biotransformation of foreign chemicals in animals. He investigated the metabolic pathway of numerous compounds in a wide variety of animal species while training large numbers of our colleagues who have been responsible for further advances in biochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology.

Richard Herbert April 1988 Preface to the first edition This is a book about experiments and results of experiments. The results described are the fruit of thirty years' labour in the field of secondary metabolism. Secondary metabolism, more than any other part of the chemistry of life, has been the special preserve of organic chemists. Investigation of secondary metabolism began with curiosity about the structures of compounds isolated from natural sources, i.e. secondary metabolites. Coeval with structure determination there has been a curiosity about the origins and mechanism of formation of secondary metabolites (or natural products as they have been called). It is the experimental outcome of this curiosity that is described here. - from Amzon",,,,,,,,"QH521.B

Rooted in the ancient legends of Alaska's Athabaskan Indians, it tells the stories of two adventurers who decide to leave the safety of their respective tribes. Bird Girl is a headstrong young woman who learned early on the skills of a hunter. When told that she must end her forays and take up the traditional role of wife and mother, she defies her family's expectations and confidently takes off to brave life on her own. Daagoo is a dreamer, curious about the world beyond. Longing to know what happens to the sun in winter, he sets out on a quest to find the legendary ""Land of the Sun."" Their stories interweave and intersect as they each face the many dangers and challenges of life alone in the wilderness. In the end, both learn that the search for individualism often comes at a high price, but that it is a price well worth paying, for through this quest comes the beginning of true wisdom. - from Amzon","History & Criticism, Native American, Contemporary, Native American Studies",,,,,,,"E99.A86W35

His odyssey of discovery was captured in journal entries, arguably the single most important documentation of 20th-century American racism ever written. More than 50 years later, this newly edited editionwhich is based on the original manuscript and includes a new design and added afterwordgives fresh life to what is still considered a contemporary book.” The story that earned respect from civil rights leaders and death threats from many others endures today as one of the great humanand humanitariandocuments of the era. In this new century, when terrorism is too often defined in terms of a single ethnic designation or religion, and the first black president of the United States is subject to hateful slurs, this record serves as a reminder that America has been blinded by fear and racial intolerance before. This is the story of a man who opened his eyes and helped an entire nation to do likewise.</P> - from Amzon","African-American & Black, United States, Memoirs, Journalists, Humor & Entertainment, State & Local, African-American Studies, Ethnic Studies, Discrimination & Racism, United States, Social Sciences",,,,,,,"E185.61.G8,2011"

But when he becomes a suspect in the murder, Nikki finds herself turning detective again. <P> When the police arrest and charge Marcellus Tyler, a black Yale sophomore and football star, who was the last person to have seen Amanda alive, Nikki resists the temptation to relax her investigation of the murder. She recognizes the possibilities of Tyler's guilt -- he does admit to an attraction to the murdered professor -- but she also suspects a rush to judgment on the part of the New Haven police. Further complicating the scenario is the reaction Tyler's arrest draws from the city's black community, as the Reverend Leroy Saunders, a local black minister, seizes the opportunity to gain the spotlight. Soon all of New Haven becomes polarized along racial lines. <P> Moving among professors, student leaders, blue-blooded alumni and black activists, Nikki is drawn into a web of adultery, greed, and racial strife in the Gothic dormitories of Yale and the mean streets of New Haven.

But that's what Texas Jack Carmine did with Linda Lobo. It was the kind of thing Jack was famous for doing. The people who knew Texas Jack Carmine - such as songwriter Bobby McGregor and Jack's uncle Vaughn Rhomer back in Iowa - called him God's only freeborn soul, rider of the summer roads, traveler of the far places. Where he was headed with dark-haired, long-legged Linda was not just back to his one-horse Texas ranch. It was somewhere he had never been: face to face with his own heart and the wild, strange things that live there. Border Music is the story of Jack and Linda, of long, hot days on a high desert ranch, nights wild with loving beneath West Texas skies, and times when their relationship tears them both apart. It's about Vietnam and the Midwest, and Vaughn Rhomer, an old man who,tries in his own fumbling way to be free. It's about men and women who work hard and care intensely, about romance and the passion that you only find once...and you never stop wanting to find again. - from Amzon","United States, Literary",,,,,,,"PS3573.A437B67

In the resultant confusion scientists, philosophers and theologians have pondered and argued; yet the separation remains. Norman Friedman correlates the quantum physics of David Bohm with the Perennial Philosophy described by Aldous Huxley and the spiritual insights of the channeled entity known as Seth to show how a single reality emerges from seemingly contradictory perspectives; a brilliant synthesis.<br>  <p>SOME OF THE MANY ENDORSEMENTS for Norman Friedman's books:  <p>“I think Bridging Science and Spirit is one of the most insightful, comprehensive, and brilliant expressions of knowledge. I shall certainly use it as a reference guide. Many abstract ideas that I was not comfortable with are now more meaningful.”<br>— Deepak Chopra, M.D., author of Ageless Body, Timeless Mind; The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success; The Way of the Wizard  <p> “Bridging Science and Spirit accomplishes a formidable task. This book will be a valuable research document for many years to come for those concerned with a perspective that honors both science and spirituality.”<br>— Fred Alan Wolf, Ph.D.; author of Taking the Quantum Leap; Parallel Universes; The Physics of the Soul  <p>“Bridging Science and Spirit correctly asks, 'How does matter originate from consciousness?' This is the fundamental question of a growing body of literature regarding the new paradigm of an idealist, consciousness-based science. Norman Friedman has made an important and thoughtful contribution to this new science.”<br>— Amit Goswami, Ph.D., Professor of Physics, University of Oregon; author of The Self-Aware Universe  <p>“A masterful job of bringing innate psychic understanding and scientific knowledge together, brilliantly showing us how all is one and one is all.”<br>— Robert F. Butts - Husband of Jane Roberts, Channel for Seth  <p>“Few have understood both science and metaphysics well enough to remove our blinders to their underlying similarities – and universal truths. Kudos to Norman Friedman for proving to be a master bridge builder.” <br>— Lynda Madden Dahl, Co-founder, Seth Network International; author of eight Seth-based books, including the Living a Safe Universe Series  <p>“An insightful synthesis of the outer frontiers of theoretical physics with the deep revelations of mystical insight, throwing important light on the reality we live in.” <br>— Peter Russell, author of The Global Brain; The White Hole in Time; The Global Brain Awakens  <p>“Some future historian will, I feel confident, identify the 'Great Debate' of the twentieth century around the question: 'What is science going to do about consciousness?' I would surmise that Norman Friedman's book Bridging Science and Spirit will turn out to be a benchmark in that inquiry. No one can read it without gaining some clarity on their own nature.”<br>— Willis Harman, Ph.D., President, Institute of Noetic Sciences; author of Global Mind Change  <p>“A brilliant synthesis of ageless wisdom and modern science. Friedman's writing provides pictures for our minds so we can 'see' reality.”<br>— Montague Ullman, Ph.D., Clinical Professor of Psychiatry, Emeritus, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, N.Y.  <p>“I responded to this book with both admiration and appreciation for the task Norman Friedman set out to do and accomplished so successfully.

To rationalize reading instruction according to these principles, he says, is to silence the voices of readers and teachers. These compelling new ideas, carefully grounded in research, show how popular solutions to problems in reading instruction--mastery learning, merit pay, and school effectiveness research--actually work against improving teachers' instructional behavior and children's learning ability.

comprehensive, updated survey of all key business functions: management,
marketing, accounting, finance, and information technology. Core topics
highlighted within these functional areas include ethics and social
responsibility, small business concerns, different forms of business
ownership, and international business concepts. In light of current
business conditions, this edition also addresses the nation\'s economic
problems, corporate credibility and efforts to improve accounting
standards, the dot-com meltdown, entrepreneurial businesses, diversity,
globalization, e-business, and other timely issues. Likewise, the authors
have integrated more information on employment trends to help students
choose a career and compete in a fickle job market. Updated and enhanced
coverage of e-Business--in boxed features, examples, illustrations, and
discussions throughout the text--reflects this sector\'s growing
importance. In addition, Navigating the World of E-Business (Chapter 4) has
been completely revamped to cover key concepts, as well as the strategies
and challenges facing current businesses. Pedagogical tools have also been
revised, including all new Inside Business cases at the beginning of each
chapter and closing Return to Inside Business features. These sections
follow up on the opening case with additional information, posing questions
that stress the practical application of chapter concepts. All boxed
features that focus on real business or workplace issues have been
replaced. These boxes cover major themes, including Adapting to Change,
Talking Technology, Examining Ethics (with Issues to Consider that
stimulate critical thinking and facilitate discussion), Going Global, and
Exploring Business. Using the Internet boxes continue to point students to
relevant web sites for more information on concepts, companies, or issues
covered in each chapter--prompting them to conduct independent research.
The Eighth Edition also features two new Spotlight features per chapter,
illustrating facts with appealing and easy-to-understand visuals that help
students to understand the material. Due to its loose-leaf format, this
text sells for considerably less than standard hardcover books and also
provides students with greater flexibility. They can insert their own notes
or class handouts into any chapter, bring only the chapters they need to
class, or organize the contents to follow their instructor\'s syllabus. The
Study Guide is perforated and three-hole punched so that the materials can
be easily integrated with the textbook. New! Building a Business Plan
features now appear at the end of every Part, helping students to write
their own business plans incrementally over the course of a semester or
during class. Chapter 6 also includes revised coverage of business plans.
New! Running a Business, an ongoing video case featured at the end of each
Part, provides students with an insider\'s vantage point of Finagle-A-
Bagel, a bagel bakery and caf. Through this firsthand look at one
business\'s day-to-day operations, students gain a better understanding of
the real challenges faced by entrepreneurs. Students can also practice
applying what they have learned by analyzing the problems, solutions, and
actions taken at Finagle-A-Bagel. New! All end-of-chapter videos are new
and focus on companies such as Stonyfield Farm, New Belgium Brewing,
Subway, Bay Partners, Remington, Wal-Mart, JetBlue, Financial Fusion, and
Merrill Lynch Direct. These cases combine with three other video tools--one
brief chapter overview and two key concept segments--for a total of 13 to
20 minutes of video per chapter. New! All photos and advertisements are
new. As in past editions, captions clarify how these real-world visuals
illustrate key concepts under review. New! The Business Bonus Pack: Your","Management, Instruction Methods, Management, Education",,,,,,,HD70.U5P68 2005

At 56, with two adult daughters and three grandchildren, she is also the oldest woman in the world to have done so. Her voyage began in 1989 and took her through 40 countries, 27,000 miles and eight years. Her longest passage at sea was her first, 36 days from Acapulco to the Marquesas Islands in the South Pacific. Sailing without sponsorship and with little money, learning as she went, Henry encountered storms, near collisions, fatigue, equipment failures, uncharted reefs, health problems and weeks of solitude in her voyage. She supported herself by selling her watercolours - one reason the trip took so long. At her nadir in New Zealand, down to her last $3, unable to sell paintings, she abandoned herself to despair and considered ending her life by stepping off the boat. But this resourceful and resilient sailor also found beauty, diversity, romance and a network of friendships around the globe. Her solo circumnavigation is a triumph to rival Joshua Slocum's -the prototype for all that have followed. Henry's adventure began with the collapse of her import business in 1988. In debt and suffering a crisis of self-doubt, she moved aboard a 21-year-old sloop to live frugally in Santa Cruz harbour while working in a shoreside graphic arts studio. But Henry's wanderlust soon propelled her out of the harbour for a ""brief cruise"" to Mexico, and then, impetuously, onward around the world, never fully realizing the magnitude of her undertaking. A voyage of eight years cannot be written as a continuous narrative. Rather, the manuscript is a rich tapestry woven from discrete, chronologically sequential episodes like those in the attached writing sample. Several recurring elements - the author's letters to her friend Kitty; brief, dated logbook entries; and brief transcripts of the Voice of America broadcasts that brought the momentous events of the world into Henry's cabin in midocean -give structure to the narrative. So, too, do the maps that open each of the book's seven sections. Buoyantly adventurous by nature, Pat Henry is also a good storyteller and an admirable protagonist. There is good travel writing here, informed by an artist's eye and an observant student of human nature. Her best writing is in her descriptive passages, whether of people, a marketplace, or a tropical anchorage. Her story will require careful editing for continuity and transition, but the end result promises to be a winner. Illustrated, full-colour endsheets show photos from the voyage as well as several of the vivid waterclours Henry painted of scenes encountered along the way. These delightful paintings tell the reader much about the storyteller. - from Amzon","Travel, Geography, Boating, Narratives, Adventure, Solo Travel, Travel Writing",,,,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gjqAAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"G440.H495H46

And after his not-so-distinguished client stepped down, Ben found himself appointed to complete the sullied senator’s term. Now, having barely gotten his political sea legs, he must rise to yet another challenge: advising the president’s next Supreme Court nominee during the sometimes thorny confirmation process. Luckily, Judge Thaddeus Roush’s popularity on both sides of the aisle looks to make him a shoo-in. Until he decides to out himself on national television–igniting a Beltway uproar and setting the stage for a bare-knuckle partisan brawl. <br><br>Forced to scramble for spin control, Ben hastily calls a press conference for the now controversial candidate. But the photo op becomes a tabloid nightmare when, on live TV, a brutally murdered woman is discovered in the judge’s backyard. For the political forces out to torpedo the nomination of a gay Supreme Court Justice, the shocking turn of events is pure gold.<br><br>With the secret backing of the president and a made-to-order new candidate waiting in the wings, the cagey senate majority leader and his most ruthless allies mount a smear campaign that would put Joe McCarthy to shame. But Team Kincaid isn’t about to let the best man for the job get derailed. <br><br>While Ben uses his best courtroom strategies to wage a war of words, his crack private eye, Loving, hits the capital streets to fight a much more hands-on battle–with hustlers, hit men, and homicidal hoods–as he digs for dirt in places even Deep Throat would avoid. It’s soon clear that this game is anything but politics as usual.<br><br>In Capitol Threat, William Bernhardt serves up a resounding one-two punch of political intrigue and legal suspense peppered with a volley of his trademark plot twists, sly wit, and persistent thrills.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i> - from Amzon","Political, Mystery, Legal, Political, Espionage, Suspense",,,,,,,"PS3552.E73147C39,2007"

Noddings believes: in principles and propostions, in terms such as
justification, fairness, and equity. The mother's voice has been silent.
The view of ethics Noddings offers in this book is a feminine view. ""This
does not imply,"" she writes, ""that all women will accept it or that most
men will reject it; indeed there is no reason why men should not embrace
it. It is feminine in the deep classical sense--rooted in receptivity,
relatedness, and responsiveness. It does not imply either that logic is to
be discarded or that logic is alien to women. It represents an aternative
to present views, one that begins with the moral attitude or longing for
goodness and not with moral reasoning."" What is at the basis of moral
action? An altruism acquired by the application of rule and principle? Or,
as Noddings asserts, caring and the memory of being cared for? With
numerous examples to supplement her rich theoretical discussion, Noddings
builds a compelling philosophical argument for an ethics based on natural
caring, as in the care of a mother for her child. The ethical behavior that
grows out of natural caring has at its core as care-filled receptivity to
those involved in any moral situation, and leaves behind the rigidity of
rule and principle to focus on what is particular and unique in human
relations. ""The hand that steadied us as we learned to ride our first
bicycle did not provide propositional knowledge, but it guided and
supported us all the same, and we finished up 'knowing how.'"" Noddings's
discussion is far-ranging, as she considers whether organizations, which
operate at a remove from the caring relationship, can truly be called
ethical. She discusses the extent to which we may truly care for plants,
animals, or ideas. Finally, she proposes a realignment of education to
encourage and reward not just rationality and trained intelligence, but
also enhanced sensitivity in moral matters.","Ethics & Morality, General, Ethics, Gender Studies",,,,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BadpuqNofskC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"BJ1475.N62

As Paul mishandles the situation, his wife takes the geologist to her bed and a fire and aborted assassination occur; Ude issues a call to arms as harrowing as any Jeremiad--and Armageddon comes rapidly closer.

The University of Utah This volume in the AgAnda for Education in a
Democracy series examines a growing movement of schools and universities
collaborating in ways that break down traditional barriers and promote
systemic educational renewal. Centers of Pedagogy offers a practical
framework for advancing university-school collaboration on educational
improvement. The authors draw from their diverse experiences as university
deans and focus on the Centers of Pedagogy model, a strategy conceived by
John Goodlad and refined by participating institutions in the National
Network for Educational Renewal. Under this model, faculty in teacher
education, the arts and sciences, and the P-12 schools work together to
provide aspiring teachers with a well-rounded education. This collaboration
ultimately improves school curricula, teaching practice, and the education
of educators. Featuring case examples from a variety of successful
partnership programs, this book studies the policies, organizational
structures, and other key conditions needed to establish such vital
centers.","Research, Experimental Methods, Instruction Methods, Education",,,,,,,LB1715.P29 1999

Written under the direction of the anthropologist Clark Wissler between 1914 and 1920, it is the culmination of the ethnographic studies of James R. Murie, himself a Pawnee, who witnessed and participated in revivals of the ceremonialism just before it finally died out.<p>Part I presents the annual ritualistic cycle of the Skiri band, giving detailed accounts of the major ceremonies and describing the role of priests, doctors, and bundles in Pawnee religion. Part II is devoted to three major doctors’ ceremonies—the White Beaver Ceremony, the Bear Dance, and the Buffalo Dance—one of the three groups known collectively as the South Bands. The descriptions include, in both the original Pawnee and an English translation, several hundred songs as well as a number of ceremonial chants and speeches that are virtually unique in the literature on American Indian religion and provide invaluable material for linguistic study. Equally valuable is the collection of vision stories that underlie the songs. As a body they provide a new perspective on the vision and its cultural patterning, and allow for a deeper understanding of the cultural and psychological bases of Pawnee religion.</P><P>Dr. Douglas R.

For several years he lived there and painted, and when he came across familiar motifs in the countryside, he took snapshots of the setting. These photographs assisted Loran in his analysis of Cézanne's composition and served as the basis for this book, which analyzes over 30 of Cézanne's paintings. This new edition brings Loran’s milestone study up-to-date with a new foreword by art historian Richard Shiff, who places Loran’s work into today’s art historical context.</div> - from Amzon","Individual Artists, Criticism, History",,,,,,,"P95.L95.6

H. van den Berg challenges a basic assumption of twentieth-century psychiatry: that human nature does not change. He asks: If earlier generations, living a different sort of life, were essentially different people, how was this so? And how has psychology, which attempts to describe people's activities, both reflected and influenced the changes that have occurred? Dr. van den Berg discusses how the relationships between parents and children have altered in the last four hundred years; what these alterations mean for education and for life patterns within Western society; why maturation has become so delayed and so difficult for our children; and some ways women have changed since the Victorian era. He goes on to discuss the social aspects of neurotic disturbance and modern man's distance from God. ""Beautiful, original, profound, and very important...

Almost fifty years later she is known as the ""First Woman of Finance,"" the only woman to head a publicly traded national brokerage firm.  Pithy, vastly entertaining, and full of behind-the-scenes anecdotes, ""Changing the Rules"" reveals how Siebert forged her phenomenal success in the chaotic and cutthroat world of Wall Street. Three four-letter words are behind Siebert's career success: One is work -- she learned everything there was to know about a company before recommending its stock. The second is luck -- as an analyst in training, she had the good fortune to follow a fledgling industry that nobody else wanted. (The ""dog"" industry was airlines.) The third word is risk -- she knew how to assess liability and make a decision.  Siebert recounts the resistance of the good gray Stock Exchange when she dared to infiltrate the boys' club, threatening to have a Port-O-San delivered to the NYSE luncheon club if they didn't add a women's bathroom. She reveals the backstage stories about saving Lockheed and selling Conrail (at the time, the largest stock offering in Wall Street history), as well as the changes on the Street that led to May Day, 1975, when she was first in line as a discount broker (and considered a pariah by industry standards).  She tells of her memorable encounters with such legendary figures as Captain Eddie Rickenbacker, the World War I flying ace who ran Eastern Airlines, and Robert Brimberg, the iconoclastic ""Scarsdale Fats"" whose investing acumen was the envy of the Street. Writing with equal candor about the politics of finance and the financeof politics, Siebert recalls her five years as Superintendent of Banking for New York State -- when she helped to prevent a national fiscal crisis during the Iran hostage situation -- and her experiences as a pro-choice Republican senatorial candidate. Siebert's reputation for rocking the boat is legendary, and ""Changing the Rules"" is both a fascinating biography of a true pioneer, and a valuable strategic and informational tool for anyone who deals with or dabbles in the money game. - from Amzon","Business, Mid Atlantic, Women, Stocks, Motivational, Women & Business",,,,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NKSZDvExLrcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"HG4928.5.S58

Wayne,,,,Oxford University Press,3,2000,,,,,NON FICTION,,Book,"Atmospheric chemistry has been the focus of much research activity in recent years, and there is now heightened public awareness of the environmental issues in which it plays a part.<br> <br> In a clear, readable style, this important book looks at the insights and interpretations afforded by the research, and places in context the exciting, dramatic, and sometimes disturbing findings.<br> <br> Like its highly successful predecessor, this new edition lays down the principles of atmospheric chemistry and provides the necessary background for more detailed study. The text has been thoroughly revised and expanded throughout to take into account recent advances in atmospheric science that include a host of new atmospheric measurements, extended laboratory experiments, ever more sophisticated models, and ingenious interpretations of the phenomena.  Heterogeneous processes are now known to be of great significance in the chemistry of the Earth's atmosphere, and new sections of the book discuss the influence o such processes on both the stratosphere and the troposphere. A major eruption, that of Mount Pinatubo, has highlighted how volcanoes can influence 'natural' atmospheric chemistry, and the opportunity is taken to examine the effects of the gases and particles produced in such eruptions.   The startling discovery of the 'Antarctic ozone hole' has now been matched by observations of similar ozone losses in the Arctic; both phenomena are explored in more depth than before, and the whole question of trends in stratospheric ozone concentrations is updated.  New topics in tropospheric chemistry that are discussed in this edition for the first time include the atmospheric chemistry of biogenic hydrocarbons, of aromatic compounds, and of halogens and halogen-containing species.<br> <br> Several  aspects have been added to the examination of air pollution, including the effects of biomass burning.  Rapid changes in the composition of the Earth's atmosphere, apparently a result of man's activities, are apparently even having an effect on global climate, and recent assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are presented in this context. Air transport continues to expand, and the influence of aircraft on atmospheric chemistry and, indeed, on climate has excited interest that is explained here. Moving away from Earth, information gathered by the Voyager, Galileo, and other space missions, which have provided a new understanding of the atmosphere of the planets other than our own, is also discussed and brought up to date.<br> <br> This book does not attempt to suggest answers to the environmental problems facing us, but it lays the foundations for the study of atmospheric chemistry on which rational decisions will need to be based. A multidisciplinary approach is taken throughout in order to highlight the interplay between the atmosphere of a planet and other parts of the environment.  This feature makes the book full of interest for chemists, physicists, biologists, and other scientists alike, and accessible to all of them. Readers will find the book an excellent introduction to an exciting topic, and a fascinating source of information about a part of science that is proving to be of key importance.<br> - from Amzon","Criticism, Physical & Theoretical, Environmental Science, Rivers, Physics, Weather, Family Practice, Earth Sciences, Chemistry, Environmental Studies, Physics",,,,,,,"QD251.3.C37

The most recent research data related to Seveso were presented by researchers from the <i>Universities of Milano</i> and <i>Pavia</i>, the <i>Joint Research Centre</i> in Ispra, the <i>""Mario Negri"" Institute for Pharmacological Research</i> in Milano and the <i>Desio</i> (Milano) <i>Hospital</i>. Major issues addressed involved measurements of the current environmental concentrations of 2,3,7,8-TCDD in different compartments (atmosphere, soil, flora, fauna and food) at Seveso and recent epidemiological data concerning the population originally exposed to dioxin and still under study. Other research results were presented by scientists of institutions from many countries such as the <i>Linköping University Hospital</i> (Sweden), the <i>National Cancer Institute</i>, Bethesda (MD, USA), the <i>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</i>, Atlanta (GA, USA), the <i>Free Universität</i>, Berlin (Germany) and the <i>Environmental Protection Office</i> (Bitterfield, Saxony Anhaly, Germany). These contributions covered different issues in dioxin research, reviewing or presenting new information on: (1) the origin, presence and movement of these compounds in the environment, (2) the mechanism of toxic action including new end-points for risk assessment, (3) the use of molecular epidemiology techniques, and (4) reports on other cases of large-scale dioxin environmental pollution. <p>This Symposium, which brought together experts in different disciplines to discuss the problem, has clearly shown that an extensive worldwide research effort, with the appropriate technical, legislative and administrative improvements, produces worthwhile results.<br> - from Amzon","Plant Design, Pollution, Health & Safety, General & Reference, Environmental Science, Technology, Social Services & Welfare, Environmental Engineering, Chemistry, Environmental Studies",,,,,,,RA578.C5C48

Laura Berk, renowned professor and researcher in the field of child development, has revised her Child Development text, adding new pedagogy, a heightened emphasis on the interplay between biology and environment, expanded coverage of culture, and an enhanced focus on education, health, and social issues, including many social policy topics addressed throughout the text. Berk's revision provides contemporary and cohesive coverage on contexts for development, including but also extending beyond the family to peers, schooling, media, neighborhoods, communities, and societal values and priorities. In the Seventh Edition, Berk consulted with Canadian contributor Stuart Shanker, accomplished professor of developmental psychology at York University, to expand the text's coverage of Canadian content and to offer an integrated North American representation of the field.This balanced North American perspective provides students with a greatly enriched opportunity to learn about social and cultural contexts for development. Berk presents both classic and emerging theories in an especially clear, engaging writing style, with a multitude of research-based and real-world examples. Strengthening the connections between theory and applications, this edition's extensive revision highlights the most recent scholarship in the field, giving students an especially clear and coherent understanding of the sequence and underlying processes of child development. The effective topical organization consistently emphasizes the interrelatedness of all development -- physical, cognitive, emotional, and social -- throughout the text narrative and in special features. - from Amzon","Child Psychology, Early Childhood, Child Psychology, General, Developmental Psychology",,,,,,,"HQ767.9.B464

With his patience and knowledge of their ways, Duffy was accepted by these, the world’s smallest people, and invited to participate in the cycle of their lives from birth to death. - from Amzon","Africa, Cultural, Specialty Boutique, Anthropology, Cultural",,,,,,,"GN49.K298

The contributions, all of which are based on the latest theories and research, demonstrate that the application of a developmental perspective to the study of young children with Down syndrome sheds light on the universality of ontogenetic sequences, stages, and structures, and highlights the respective roles of biological, perceptual-cognitive, linguistic, social, and emotional factors in the developmental process. Finally, it is shown that the application of a developmental perspective will suggest age and stage-appropriate interventions for Down syndrome children and their families.    This will be a suitable book for psychologists, psychiatrists, special education teachers, pediatricians, and other medical researchers interested in Down syndrome and mental retardation, as well as graduate students in these areas. - from Amzon","Psychology & Counseling, Foreign Language Study & Reference, Pediatrics, General, Pediatrics, Psychology",,,,,,,RJ506.D68C49

What the children say shows that it is the adults in the school who control their experience. These adults control not only their learning but the values they should imbibe, their experience of schools as well as their experience of themselves.<br /><br />Dympna Devine powerfully makes the case powerfully for children to have a more democratic and inclusive school experience that positions them as citizens and not just as potential citizens in the making. Children should be treated as full participants in school and have the right to expect their views to be taken seriously by the adults in their schools. And, as this book shows, they are eloquent about how this can be done.<br /><br />This is a book for policy makers, school managers and teachers.

'We are living in privileged times. There is an upsurge of life in the church that is revitalizing the entire body from head to toes. The church has been placed on the road to renewal, which will surely result in a new manifestation of the church as institution. There are powerful and living forces, particularly at the grassroots, that are not sufficiently recognized by the traditional channels of the church's present organization. The grassroots are asking for a new structure, a new ecclesial division of labour and of religious power, for this a new vision of the church is necessary. This vision has not yet been developed systematically in a way that responds to the demands of our global reality, but is necessary given what is happening in Latin America and elsewhere in the world. The present book does not pretend to fill this need. It does, however, take on certain challenges, raise criticisms, make suggestions for a new model of the church, and reflect on them in a radical way. This book will most certainly be understood by them precisely in as much as they have overcome the triumphalist mentality. Others will judge this work as superfluous and even inopportune. This will not trouble me in the least. What readily comes to mind is the thought of St Augustine, echoed by the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. And many before us, leading this life, trod tortuous paths which we were obliged to follow, with the weariness and suffering imposed on the sons of Adam.' - from Amzon",,,,,,,,"BX1746.B52513

Pollock have examined decades of research findings to distill the results into nine broad teaching <i>strategies that have positive effects on student learning: </i>  <P>   * Identifying similarities and differences.<BR>    * Summarizing and note taking.<BR>    * Reinforcing effort and providing recognition.<BR>    * Homework and practice.<BR>    * Nonlinguistic representations.<BR>    * Cooperative learning.<BR>    * Setting objectives and providing feedback.<BR>    * Generating and testing hypotheses.<BR>    * Questions, cues, and advance organizers.  <P>This list is not new. But what is surprising is finding out <i>what a big difference</i> it makes, for example, when students learn how to take good notes, work in groups, and use graphic organizers. The authors provide statistical <i>effect sizes</i> and show how these translate into <i>percentile gains</i> for students, for each strategy. And each chapter presents extended classroom examples of teachers and students in action; models of successful instruction; and many ""frames,"" rubrics, organizers, and charts to help teachers plan and implement the strategies. - from Amzon","Education & Reference, Reference, Research, Instruction Methods, Economics, Education",,,,,,,LB1025.3.M339 2001

The use of technology, primarily graphing utilities, is assumed throughout the text. The development of each topic proceeds from the concrete to the abstract and takes full advantage of technology, wherever appropriate.  The first major objective of this book is to encourage students to investigate mathematical ideas and processes graphically and numerically, as well as algebraically. Proceeding in this way, students gain a broader, deeper, and more useful understanding of a concept or process. Even though concept development and technology are emphasized, manipulative skills are not ignored, and plenty of opportunities to practice basic skills are present. A brief look at the table of contents will reveal the importance of the function concept as a unifying theme.   The second major objective of this book is the development of a library of elementary functions, including their important properties and uses. Having this library of elementary functions as a basic working tool in their mathematical tool boxes, students will be able to move into calculus with greater confidence and understanding. In addition, a concise review of basic algebraic concepts is included in Appendix A for easy reference, or systematic review.   The third major objective of this book is to give the student substantial experience in solving and modeling real world problems. Enough applications are included to convince even the most skeptical student that mathematics is really useful.

As most homosexual educators, and even students, remain invisible due to possible hostilities of “coming out,” this eye-opening book presents recent research to help gay and lesbian teachers break their silence. It encourages them to speak out on issues of homosexuality where curricula, civil rights, personal freedoms, and social entitlements are concerned. It promotes the development of school-based intervention for gay, lesbian, and bisexual students.</br></br>While the controversy over education and homosexuality is one of the most personally threatening in this nation’s history, the timely research presented in Coming Out of the Classroom Closet will hearten gay and lesbian educators to continue to strive for fair treatment as peers and for equal representation in educational materials. Pointing to reports of greater social support and legal protection than is assumed by most in the educational system, this book should be required reading for all persons concerned about continuing to provide high-quality education at all levels--college and university, secondary, and even elementary.</br></br>Chapters of Coming Out of the Classroom Closet look closely at many issues surrounding the issue of homosexuality in schools, including a history of treatment of gay and lesbian educators and their legal rights; effects of internalized homophobia on homosexual educators; gay and lesbian student’s perceptions of their counselors and teachers ability to understand and help; beliefs, lack of knowledge, and lack of training of counselors and teachers about the needs of gay and lesbian youth; images of gays and lesbians in sexuality and health textbooks; important AIDS education; and the issue of homophobia. - from Amzon","Coming Out, General, Gay & Lesbian, Student Life, Education, Gay & Lesbian Studies, Gender Studies",,,,,,,LC1926.C66

As Sheryl (English), Dan (science), Bernie (social studies), and Tim (special education) forge bonds of community, collaboration, and collegiality, their experiences take on the dimensions of an epic journey, or odyssey. Interpreted through an ecological lens, this book offers important insight into the world of teaching in an era of school reform. The Connections journey was marked both by stories of triumph and tales of crisis. The stories reflected an emerging vision not only of Connections as an interdisciplinary program, but of the teaching team as a collaborative, collegial community. By illuminating the real world of Connections, this book offers insights for teachers and administrators, policy makers and students, and all who value community, collaboration, and collegiality in schools. - from Amzon",,,,,,,,LB2805.D67 1998

Jack Bevan's remarkable translation of Quasimodo's entire poetic oeuvre fills a great gap in our knowledge of twentieth-century European poetry. `The poetry is textured like shot silk, yet the elegance and syntactical lucidity with which Jack Bevan has worked to bring these poems to English readers enables them to stand as poems in their own right', as Peter Scupham wrote of Jack Bevan's translation of Quasimodo's last poems, `Debit and Credit'.  <P>Quasimodo's strong and passionate poetry continues to testify to the human (and inhuman) realities which have created our modern world: as the Italian critic Giuliano Dego wrote, `To bear witness to man's history in all the urgency of a particular time and place, and to teach the lesson of courage, this has been Quasimodo's poetic task.' - from Amzon",,,,,,,,"PQ4837.U3A23

In this book, Alan Burns and Andy Wellings provide a thorough and self-contained account of concurrent programming in Ada, and show users how to harness the full power of the language. Starting with an overview of the nonconcurrent features of Ada, the authors examine in detail the uses of concurrent programming and the inherent difficulties in providing interprocess communication. They introduce the Ada tasking model, and explain system programming, real-time issues, distribution, object-oriented programming, and reuse. This is the first book to deal with concurrent features in the new Ada standard, and it offers practical advice to both programmers working with embedded systems and those interested more broadly in the development of programming languages.  Many otherwise inaccessible issues are probed in depth, making this book invaluable to professional software engineers and advanced students of programming alike. Every Ada programmer will find it essential reading and a primary reference work. - from Amzon","Networks, Protocols & APIs, Software Development, Software, Ada, Mathematics, Networking, Programming Languages, Software Design & Engineering",,,,,,,"HF5657.4637

It concerns unactualized human capabilities, opportunities and adventures for all of us in the years ahead. <P>For the first time, a rigorous experimental protocol is available to allow human qualities to meaningfully alter the properties of physical materials via specific human intentions! <P>The experimental data portion of this book shows, via the use of IIEDs (Intention Imprinted Electrical Devices), how human intention can robustly influence physical reality with measurement amplitude changes by as much as 100 times the instrument measurement accuracy. <P>The described experiments deal with inorganic materials like water, in vitro organic materials like enzymes and in vitro living systems like fruit fly larvae. <P>This experimental data shows how after ~3 months of continued use of the IIEDs in a particular laboratory space, that space becomes “conditioned” to a higher state of physics Gauge symmetry than present in normal locales. <P>In a “conditioned” space, human intention acts as a true thermodynamic potential to significantly influence the many chemical, electrical and biological processes of nature. <P>This book also provides a “work in progress” – type of theoretical model that allows us to explain how this experimental procedure works to produce such striking changes in measurement amplitudes. <P>As Professor George Sudarshan (Physics Department, University of Texas, Austin) says: “Your new book, I am sure, may long be remembered as the book that started out the scientific work in a new area and thus created a new era in science.” <P>As Professor Rustum Roy (Director, Materials Research Laboratory, Pennsylvania State University) says: “This book by Tiller, Dibble and Kohane is at once a ‘magnum opus’ and a ‘tour de force’.

particularly like the way it is laid out. I believe that helping the

is extremely important. Immediately following this topic the students then
move directly into diversity, which includes the understanding the meaning
of language and culture. Both of these topics form the basis for the rest
of the course. Overall, I believe that this book is an excellent text for
teaching in the Content Area."" "" Randy M. Wood, Baylor University """" The
strengths of this text include the authors in depth knowledge of the field
of content area reading. Their chapter on assessing textbooks is invaluable
for secondary teachers who don't understand the difficulty of some
textbooks and the problems these texts can cause students. The chapter on
multiculturalism and the ESL learner is a strength. The chapter on
vocabulary is outstanding."" "" Patricia J. Pollifrone, Gannon University

ranging from brief conversations with journalists to more extended and
leisurely conversations with academics and writers. Winner of two National
Book Awards and a Pulitzer Prize, this universally praised author of The
Magic Barrel, The Fixer, The Natural, and many stories that are acclaimed
among the masterpieces of American fiction appears in these interviews
quite appropriately as an artist devoted more to his work than to
discussing it. This collection includes interviews in which Malamud gives a
commentary on each of his novels and on many of his short stories. What
emerges from these encounters with this great author is a sense of
Malamud's deep, lifetime commitment to his art and to a seriousness of
purpose. Though there is very little domestic detail or literary gossip in
Malamud's conversations, these interviews reveal the essence of a great
writer that the multitudes of readers inspired by his books crave to find

I had an immediate and deep experience of self-love with it."" --John Bradshaw, author, Creating Love  ""One of the most important works I have come across in any field, Core Transformation should be adopted as the principal therapy by every therapist in the country, understood and practiced by everyone in the helping and legal professions, as well as parents and teachers.

of ""bridging the worlds between educator and students."" There is perhaps no
task more fundamental to effective teaching and learning. All too often a
distinct gap develops or cannot be overcome between instructor and student,
one that leaves each struggling to understand the other's position. The
professional quest for principles of structure and process that can help
close this divide is both evolving and unending. This book is intended to
help college faculty create conditions in which students learn to construct
knowledge in their disciplines and achieve self-authorship. A significant,
and often overlooked, dimension mediating learning and self-authorship
centers on learners' ways of knowing, or their assumptions about the
nature, limits, and certainty of knowledge. A learner who assumes that all
knowledge is certain expects to hear answers from an authority figure; in
contrast, a learner who views knowledge as relative expects to explore
multiple viewpoints. By taking a constructive-developmental approach,
Baxter Magolda demonstrates how students' ability to construct knowledge is
intertwined with the development of their assumptions about knowledge
itself and their role in creating it. She shows how the structure of
constructive-developmental teaching hinges on three principles: validating
students' ability to know, situating learning in students' experience, and
defining learning as teachers and students mutually constructing meaning.
Unlike most of the literature on the subject, this book takes abstract
pedagogical principles and translates them into practical methods. By
observing four semester-length college courses in mathematics, zoology,
human development, and education and intensively interviewing students and
their instructors, Baxter Magolda provides much-needed, concrete principles
that will lead to valuable improvements in the classroom environment. With
an enhanced level of understanding of the teaching-learning relationship,
professors will be able to teach better, and students will be able to learn
better, thus preparing them to meet the demands inherent in adulthood and
preparing them to take an active role in creating a better society. Those
actively involved in higher education, whether college faculty or students
in graduate programs, as well as anyone focused on education in general
will find much of interest in this book.","Mexico, Higher & Continuing Education, Reform & Policy, Instruction Methods",,,,,,,"LB1025.3.B39

they can sustain continuous innovation and improvement in order to create

define the norms and expressions of the school’s organizational
culture¾recruitment and induction, knowledge transmission, power and
authority, evaluation, direction, and boundaries¾and shows what it takes to
lead effective systemic change in order to sustain new values and
direction. The book is filled with effective strategies and offers
guidelines for introducing the “disruptive innovations” that are necessary
to change the fundamental norms of an educational organization and truly
revitalize a school. He offers suggestions for working through the thorny

However, ethnicity and race have historically meant different things in the United States. What does it mean to refer to racial minorities as ethnic minorities? What are the social dynamics that have led to a broadening of the discourse on diversity and multiculturalism to include more types of culturally-based differences, while the practice of labeling those who are not white as 'other' continues apace? In Critical Ethnicity, leading scholars from several disciplines explore the interactions of ethnicity, race, and education in the United States, which are embedded within discussions of diversity, multiculturalism, and identity politics. Contributors to this volume, including Stanley Aronowitz, Lilia I. Bartolome, Donaldo Macedo, Michelle Fine, Lois Weis, Linda C.

properties of the cytochrome P-450 system. These advances stem, in
practical terms, from the generally recognized importance of cytochrome
P-450 in the metabolism of drugs and in the bioactivation of xenobiotics to
toxic products. The fascinating multiplicity and differential regulation of
cytochrome P-450 isozymes, and their ability to catalyze extraordinarily
difficult chemical transformations, have independently drawn many chemists
and biochemists into the P-450 circle. Progress in the field, from a
technical point of view, has been propelled by the de velopment of reliable
procedures for the purification of membrane-bound enzymes, by the growing
repertoire of molecular biological techniques, and by the development of
chemical models that mimic the catalytic action of P-450. As a result, our
understanding of the P-450 system is moving from the descriptive,
pharmacological level into the tangible realm of atomic detail. The rapid
progress and multidisciplinary character of the cytochrome P-450 field,
which cuts across the lines that traditionally divide disciplines as
diverse as inorganic chemistry and genetics, have created a need for an up-
to-date evaluation of the advances that have been made. It is hoped that
this book, with its molecular focus on the cytochrome P-450 system, will
alleviate this need. The authors of the individual chapters have strived to
emphasize recent results without sacrificing the background required to
make their chapters comprehensible to informed nonspecialists.","Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Chemistry, Biology",,,,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=J_bcXCdZ75QC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"QP671.C83C98

Behind this simple equation lies a revolution in the study of knowledge, which has left the halls of philosophy for the labs of science. This book offers a cogent account of what such a move does to our understanding of the nature of learning, rationality, and intelligence. Bringing together evolutionary biology, psychology, and philosophy, Henry Plotkin presents a new science of knowledge, one that traces an unbreakable link between instinct and our ability to know. Contrary to the modern liberal idea that knowledge is something derived from experience, this science shows us that what we know is what our nature allows us to know, what our instincts tell us we must know. Since our ability to know our world depends primarily on what we call intelligence, intelligence must be understood as an extension of instinct. Drawing on contemporary evolutionary theory, especially notions of hierarchical structure and universal Darwinism, Plotkin tells us that the capacity for knowledge, which is what makes us human, is deeply rooted in our biology and, in a special sense, is shared by all living things. This leads to a discussion of animal and human intelligence as well as an appraisal of what an instinct-based capacity for knowledge might mean to our understanding of language, reasoning, emotion, and culture. The result is nothing less than a three-dimensional theory of our nature, in which all knowledge is adaptation and all adaptation is a specific form of knowledge. - from Amzon","Neuropsychology, Cognitive Psychology, Evolution, Magnetism, Cognitive, Neuropsychology, Epistemology, Epistemology, Biology & Life Sciences, Cognitive Psychology, Neuropsychology",,,,,,,"BD161.P6

in a systematic manner using the most popular professional social
statistics program on the market today. Written in ten manageable chapters,
this book first introduces students to the approach researchers use to
frame research questions and the logic of establishing causal relations.
Students are then oriented to the SPSS program and how to examine data
sets. Subsequent chapters guide them through univariate analysis, bivariate
analysis, graphic analysis, and multivariate analysis. Students conclude
their course by learning how to write a research report and by engaging in
their own research project. Each book is packaged with a disk containing
the GSS (General Social Survey) file and the States data files. The GSS
file contains 100 variables generated from interviews with 2,900 people,
concerning their behaviors and attitudes on a wide variety of issues such
as abortion, religion, prejudice, sexuality, and politics. The States data
allows comparison of all 50 states with 400 variables indicating issues

But when Eve lists one of the last unspoiled parcels on the Chesapeake Bay, she has no idea what conflicts have been set in motion, and things become as chaotic as the most crowded of subway rides.<P> Eve is showing a house to a client, politician Vince Darner, and his wife--the former just happens to be in the midst of a heated campaign--when she witnesses a water-skiing accident.  It is only the beginning of a nasty war that pits environmentalist against developer, politician against politician, and neighbor against neighbor.  The next day Eve accompanies her aunt Lillian to a court hearing to determine if Lillian's neighbor Carl Rainey will get a variance to build a huge house on the property next to hers.  When environmentalists and documentary filmmaker Lauren DeWitt shows up with evidence that the house cannot legally be built, the variance is denied. Eve and Aunt Lillian become scapegoats for the animosity that is sweeping through the town over the debate.<P> As things heat up with a fatal fire and the death of Lauren DeWitt, Eve realizes that the threat is no longer just to the environment.  She is forced to team up with her competitor and possible love interest, real estate agent Mitch Gaylin.  It seems that a lot of people, including Mrs. Darner, have secrets to hide.

As far back as 1886, the Supreme Court said that ""because of local ill feeling, the people of the United States where [Indian tribes] are found are often their deadliest enemies."" This book examines the history of troubled relations on and around Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota over the last three decades and asks why Lakota Indians and whites living there became hostile to one another. Thomas Biolsi's important study traces the origins of racial tension between Native Americans and whites to federal laws themselves, showing how the courts have created opposing political interests along race lines.<BR><BR>Drawing on local archival research and ethnographic fieldwork on Rosebud Reservation, Biolsi argues that the court's definitions of legal rights—both constitutional and treaty rights—make solutions to Indian-white problems difficult.

admission and graduation? Not enough to keep America competitive, and not
enough to provide our citizens with fulfilling lives. When A Nation at Risk
called attention to the problems of our public schools in 1983, that
landmark report provided a convenient ""cover"" for higher education,
inadvertently implying that all was well on America's campuses. Declining
by Degrees blows higher education's cover. It asks tough--and long overdue
--questions about our colleges and universities. In candid, coherent, and
ultimately provocative ways, Declining by Degrees reveals: - how students
are being short-changed by lowered academic expectations and standards;
-why many universities focus on research instead of teaching and spend more
on recruiting and athletics than on salaries for professors; -why students
are disillusioned; -how administrations are obsessed with rankings in news
magazines rather than the quality of learning; -why the media ignore the
often catastrophic results; and -how many professors and students have an
unspoken ""non-aggression pact"" when it comes to academic effort. Declining
by Degrees argues persuasively that the multi-billion dollar enterprise of
higher education has gone astray. At the same time, these essays offer
specific prescriptions for change, warning that our nation is in fact at
greater risk if we do nothing.","Higher & Continuing Education, Education Theory, Education",,,,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4EvoBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"LA227.4.D45

He saw that how his patients thought about and saw life, affected and seemed to create whatever their current state of health was. He has stated that it is not enough to heal the particular illness without understanding the emotional and psychological basis for the ailment or problem. We must heal the entire person...not just a specific part. Dr. Miller has had great success with guided imagery to promote physical health and emotional well-being. He has even been successful using guided imagery to do minor surgery without any anesthetic, again proving the mind/body connection, and the control of our bodies by our thoughts. Through the presentation of stories, reflections, and case studies, Dr. Miller presents his wonderful, deep healing theories that will instill a new sense of hope and optimism into all who read this book. - from Amzon","Self-Help, Healing, Spiritualism, Spiritualism, Self-Help, Healing, Alternative Therapies",,,,,,,R733.M54

Written for presidents, deans, trustees, faculty, and distance education providers, this book outlines a dynamic new approach to distance learning and shows that the ability to manage knowledge, rather than just accumulate it, should be the chief priority of higher education in a technological world. The author decries the use of distance education to simply expand enrollments and demonstrates how effective education can connect knowledge across fields and age levels rather than segmenting it. He also shows how the rich resources of the Internet can be plumbed creatively to add depth and meaning to the college curriculum and to immerse learners, whether in the classroom or at a distance, in a continuum of knowledge and experience. - from Amzon","Education & Reference, Computers & Technology, Reference, Higher & Continuing Education, Schools & Teaching, Economics, Computer Science, Education",,,,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RIOdAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,LB2395.7.W45 2002

We confront one another as aggrieved groups rather than as free citizens. Cynicism, boredom, apathy, despair, violence—these have become coin of the civic realm. They are dark signs of the times and a warning that democracy may not be up to the task of satisfying the yearnings it unleashes—yearnings for freedom, fairness, and equality.In this timely, thought-provoking book, one of America's leading political philosophers and public intellectuals questions whether democracy will prove sufficiently robust and resilient to survive the century. Beginning with a catalogue of our discontents, Jean Bethke Elshtain asks what has gone wrong and why. She draws on examples from America and other parts of the world as she explores the politics of race, ethnicity, and gender identity—controversial, and essential, political issues of our day. Insisting that there is much to cherish in our democratic traditions, she concludes that democracy involves a permanent clash between conservatism and progressive change.Elshtain distinguishes her own position from those of both the Left and the Right, demonstrating why she has been called one of our most interesting and independent civic thinkers. Responding to critics of democracy, ancient and modern, Elshtain urges us to have the courage of our most authentic democratic convictions. We need, she insists, both hope and a sense of reality.Writing her book for citizens, not experts, Elshtain aims to open up a dialogue and to move us beyond sterile sectarian disputes. <I>Democracy on Trial</I> will generate wide debate and controversy.</Div></div> - from Amzon","Democracy, National, General, Government, Political Ideologies",,,,,,,"JK31.E57

Blount,,,,State University of New York Press,,1998,,,,,NON FICTION,,Book,"<i>Tells the story of women and school leadership in America from the common school era to the present. Offers an historical account of how teaching became women's work and the school superintendency men's.<br><br></i>In 1909, when she became the superintendent of the Chicago schools, Ella Flagg Young proclaimed that women were ""destined to rule the schools of every city."" After all, women accounted for nearly eighty percent of all teachers by 1910 and their ascendance into formal school leadership positions could not be far behind. After World War II, however, a backlash against single women educators and a rigid realignment of gender roles in schools contributed to a rapid decline of women school administrators across the country, a decline from which there has been little recovery to the present.<br><br><i>Destined to Rule the Schools</i> tells the story of women and school leadership in America from the common school era to the present. In a broad sense, it offers an historical account of how teaching became women's work and the school superintendency men's. Blount explores how power in school employment has been structured unequally by gender. It focuses on the superintendency because an important component of the effort to establish control of schools has occurred in contesting the definition of this position. Unique and important contributions of this volume include: the only published comprehensive statistical study describing the number of women superintendents throughout the twentieth century, an analysis suggesting that the superintendency may have become an appointive position in part to remove it from the influence of newly enfranchised women voters, a discussion of the role of homophobia in creating and perpetuating rigid gender divisions in school employment, and a broad analysis that integrates the histories of teaching and school administration.<br><br>""Jackie Blount's work is both painstakingly researched and originally conceptualized, as it mines a field historians may have thought they knew. This important book on women who administered schools discusses identity, sexuality, power, authority, and educational practice. And it's a first-rate read!"" -- Sari Biklen, Syracuse University<br><br>""Jackie Blount's intellect, scholarship, writing skill, and sensitivity to gender inequity and its tenacious hold on our society combine to give us a powerful book that is unparalleled in the literature on the topic to date."" -- Sandra L.

Because of the bewildering array of strategies offered by various advocates, many educators are confused about just what it means to ""teach thinking"" and how, other than buying a packaged program, schools can provide for it. As a partial answer, the authors of Dimensions of Thinking have developed a framework intended to be the basis for curriculum and staff development programs. They have organized and clarified research and theory from several sources, including philosophy and cognitive psychology in a form intended to be useful to practitioners. As you read Dimensions of Thinking, you may be challenged to rethink conventional views on such matters as student motivation and reward systems and the relationship between thinking skills and content knowledge. You will doubtless begin to wonder about the possible impact of teaching thinking on the perennial problems of student failure, disillusionment, and unmet potential. And you will probably be excited by the possibility of gains in student achievement that we usually only dream about. Because this publication challenges traditional notions about purposes and methods of instruction, it has implications for preservice and in-service teacher education and for refocusing the efforts of supervisors, principals, superintendents, and boards of education. A powerful yet flexible model, Dimensions of Thinking promises to influence education far into the future.

This groundbreaking book by Michel Foucault, the most influential philosopher since Sartre, compels us to reevaluate our assumptions about all the ensuing reforms in the penal institutions of the West. For as Foucault examines innovations that range from the abolition of torture to the institution of forced labor and the appearance of the modern penitentiary, he suggests that punishment has shifted its focus from the prisoner's body to his soul-and that our very concern with rehabilitation encourages and refines criminal activity.    Lucidly reasoned and deftly marshaling a vast body of research, Discipline and Punish is a genuinely revolutionary book, whose implications extend beyond the prison to the minute power relations of our society. - from Amzon","Modern, Criminology",,,,,,,"HV8666.F6813

VanLaeys illustrates the profound content that dreams can contain about
where life will take us and about the spiritual and emotional guidance
those drams can offer us. VanLaeys shows us how to attend to what our

The author became aware of the need for a book such as this when he was helping make Indian costumes for exhibitions and dances. He searched early monographs, other reliable documents, and museums to compile for his own use the information on which this book is based.</p><p>The hobbyist, as well as the historian and anthropologist, will find here the information he has been seeking: patterns of shirts, robes, and moccasins; colors and designs used by specific tribes; the symbolism of details of ceremonial dress.

But for eldest daughter Beata, it was also a summer of awakening. By the glimmering waters of Lake Geneva, the quiet Jewish beauty met a young French officer and fell in love. Knowing that her parents would never accept her marriage to a Catholic, Beata followed her heart anyway. And as the two built a new life together, Beata’s past would stay with her in ways she could never have predicted. For as the years pass, and Europe is once again engulfed in war, Beata must watch in horror as Hitler’s terror threatens her life and family—even her eighteen-year-old daughter Amadea, who has taken on the vows of a Carmelite nun.<br><br>For Amadea, the convent is no refuge. As family and friends are swept away without a trace, Amadea is forced into hiding. Thus begins a harrowing journey of survival, as she escapes into the heart of the French Resistance.  Here Amadea will find a renewed sense of purpose, taking on the most daring missions behind enemy lines. And it is here, in the darkest moments of fear, that Amadea will feel her mother’s loving strength—and that of her mother’s mother before her–as the voices of lost loved ones echo powerfully in her heart. And here, amid the fires of war, Amadea will meet an extraordinary man, British secret agent Rupert Montgomery. In Colonel Montgomery, Amadea finds a man who will help her discover her place in an unbreakable chain between generations…and between her lost family and her dreams for the future—a future she is only just beginning to imagine: a future of hope rooted in the rich soil of the past.<br><br>With the grace of a master storyteller, Danielle Steel breathes life into history, creating a bold, sweeping tale filled with unforgettable characters and breathtaking images—from the elegant rituals of Europe’s prewar aristocracy to the brutal desperation of Germany’s death camps. Drawing us into a vanished world, Echoes weaves an intricate tapestry of a mother’s love, a daughter’s courage…and the unwavering faith that sustained them—even in history’s darkest hour. - from Amzon","Historical, Family Saga, Jewish, Military, War, Contemporary Women, Contemporary, Military",,,,,,,"PS3569.T33828E23

Unfortunately, modern American culture has not paid much attention.<br><br>White settlers did learn a few plant-based remedies from the Indians, and a few prairie plants were prescribed by frontier doctors. A couple dozen prairie species were listed as drugs in the U.S. Pharmacopeia at one time or another, and one or two, like the Purple Coneflower, found their way into the bottles of patent medicine.<br><br>But in both the number of species used and the varieties of treatments administered, Indians were far more proficient than white settlers. Their familiarity with the plants of the prairie was comprehensive—there probably were Indian names for all prairie plants, and they recognized more varieties of some species than scientists do today. Their knowledge was refined and exact enough that they could successfully administer medicinal doses of plants that are poisonous. All of the species used by frontier doctors were used first by Indians.<br><br>In <i>Medicinal Plants of the Prairie</i>, ethnobotanist Kelly Kindscher documents the medicinal use of 203 native prairie plants by the Plains Indians. Using information gleaned from archival materials, interviews, and fieldwork, Kindscher describes plant-based treatments for ailments ranging from hyperactivity to syphilis, from arthritis to worms. He also explains the use of internal and external medications, smoke treatments, moxa (the burning of a medicinal substance on the skin), and the doctrine of signatures (the belief that the form or characteristics of a plant are signatures or signs that reveal its medicinal uses). He adds information on recent pharmacological findings to further illuminate the medicinal nature of these plants.<br><br>Not since 1919 has the ethnobotany of native Great Plains plants been examined so thoroughly. Kindscher's study is the first to encompass the entire Prairie Bioregion, a one-million-square-mile area bounded by Texas on the south, Canada on the north, the Rocky Mountains on the west, and the deciduous forests of Missouri, Indiana, and Wisconsin in the east. Along with information on the medicinal uses of prairie plants by the Indians, Kindscher also lists Indian, common, and scientific names and describes Anglo folk uses, medical uses, scientific research, and cultivation. Descriptions of the plants are supplemented by 44 exquisite line drawings and over 100 range maps.<br><br>This book will help increase appreciation for prairie plants at a time when prairies and their biodiversity urgently need protection throughout the region. - from Amzon","Botany, Plants, Zoology, Nature & Ecology",,,,,,,"QK98.5.U6K56,1987"

Noddings argues that public schools should address the fundamental questions that teenagers inevitably rasie about the nature, value and meaning of life (and death), and to do so across the curriculum without limiting such existential and metaphysical discussions to separate religion, philosophy or even history classes. Explorations of the existence of a God or gods, and the value and validity of religious belief for societies or individuals, she writes “whether they are initiated by students or teachers, should be part of the free exchange of human concerns—a way in which people share their awe, doubts, fears, hopes, knowledge and ignorance.” Such basic human concerns, Noddings maintains, are relevant to nearly every subject and should be both non-coercive and free from academic evalution.</p><p>“Nel Noddings probes the many ways in which children’s questions about God and gods, existence, and the meaning of life can and should be integrated into life in classrooms and the real world of the public schools.”<br /> —<em><strong></strong></em>From the Foreword</p><p>“This is a rich and sensitive book that will give teachers, administrators, parents, philosophers of education—any concerned citizen—the basis for more substantial discussion and concrete proposals.”<br />—<strong><em>Free Inquiry</em></strong></p><p>“Impressive in its sweep of possibilities for exploration in the school curriculum and teacher education.”<br />—<strong><em>Educational Theory</em></strong></p> - from Amzon","Education, Education Theory, Instruction Methods, Curricula, Specialty Boutique, Curricula, Aims & Objectives, Education",,,,,,,LC405.N63

The orientation is to facilitate understanding of how educational organizations function as learning and socio-political systems, and then provide conceptual and analytical tools to facilitate real-world problem solving. Social and behavioral science frameworks are used to identify and explain three widely held perspectives on the administration of educational organizations: (1) the school as a bureaucratic system, (2) the school as a social system, and (3) the school as an open system. Specific chapters are dedicated to key topics such as communication, leadership, management styles, motivation, organizational memory and learning, educational marketing, institution theory, schools of choice (e.g., charter, voucher, home schooling), and educational change. <B></B> For educational administrators, and those involved with educational leadership.     </P> - from Amzon","Business & Money, Administration",,,,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dpYFAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,LB2805.H297

Eliot and James Joyce. Sultan engages in a unique form of historical criticism, blending a literary history of Modernism with a richly intimate knowledge of its key works--""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,"" <em>The Waste Land</em>, and <em>Ulysses</em>--and confronting questions of literary theory implicit in the modernist period. In doing so, he examines the antecedents of Modernism, focusing on three major influences--Flaubert, Baudelaire, and Dostoyevsky--and then traces the influence of Eliot and Joyce on their contemporaries, including Virginia Woolf and Wallace Stevens.  Concluding with an appraisal of Eliot's and Joyce's impact on the readers and writers of today, <em>Eliot, Joyce and Company</em> sheds considerable light on the careers of these writers, on their works, and on the history of Modernism. - from Amzon","Reference, Criticism & Theory, Modernism, United States, British & Irish, British & Irish, Linguistics",,,,,,,"PR478.M658

Iron Hawk represents the culmination of Deloria's colloquial style of synthesizing from memory rather than transcribing from tape or written notes. The story traces the development of a culture hero, from his early education by a grandfather, through a series of instructive adolescent mistakes, to the achievement of marriage and leadership in the tribe. But in refusing to romanticize camp circle life, Deloria also includes Iron Hawk's captivation by a seductive woman, and his return to the work of tribal continuance, when he is rescued by his son. A series of interpretive chapters follow the text to provide suggestions for literary criticism, as well as information on child-rearing and the symbolism of meadowlarks, fire, clothing, and eastward movement. - from Amzon","Mythology, Folklore & Mythology, Native American Studies",,,,,,,"E99.03D4513

The introductory stories illustrate courage in three extraordinary women and Deloria's ability to subordinate her voice to that of different narrators. Another tale, ""The Prairie Dogs,"" explains how the warriors' and chiefs' societies, the strongest forces for social cohesion, came into being.  <P>The longest story, ""The Buffalo People,"" concerns the origin of tribal identity based on such ideal qualities as the strength and generosity of the buffalo and the resiliency and grace of the corn. In her retelling of the story Deloria improvises upon the poetic conventions of oral performance.

Readers can now rely on Encyclopedia of North American Indians for an authentic and often surprising portrait of the complexities of the Native American experience. Written by more than 260 contemporary authorities, the volume features many Native American contributors - including eminent writers, tribal elders, scholars, and activists - with voices as distinct as their subjects, offering a deeper and more informed appreciation of American Indian life, past and present. Illustrated with many rare photographs, the Encyclopedia features articles on subjects such as mound builders, reservations, cigar-store Indians, child rearing, powwows, boarding schools, museums and collectors, dreams, the occupation of Alcatraz, and the impact of American Indian civilizations on Europe and the world. Contemporary topics include gambling, sports mascots, alcoholism, urban Indians, and the status of women. Biographies illuminate not only famous chiefs and warriors but an enormously diverse group of historical figures, such as Pauline Johnson, a Mohawk who becme the first American Indian woman to publish poetry; Charles Curtis, a Kaw Indian who served as vice president under Herbert Hoover; and ""Chief"" Bender, an Ojibwa who played and coached professional baseball and is lauded in the Baseball hall of Fame.

Now he turns his eye to an array of technologies that could change our relationship not with the rest of nature but with ourselves. He explores the frontiers of genetic engineering, robotics, and nanotechnology―all of which we are approaching with astonishing speed―and shows that each threatens to take us past a point of no return. We now stand, in Michael Pollan's words, ""on a moral and existential threshold,"" poised between the human past and a post-human future. McKibben offers a celebration of what it means to be human, and a warning that we risk the loss of all meaning if we step across the threshold. Instantly acclaimed for its passion and insight, this wise and eloquent book argues that we cannot forever grow in reach and power―that we must at last learn how to say, ""Enough.""</p> - from Amzon","Bioengineering, Reference, Genetics, History & Philosophy, Technology, Sociology, Politics & Government",,,,,,,"QH438.7.M38

As Asante makes clear, America continues to be a nation of two peoples with very different histories and perspectives - a white majority that mainly perceives a land of promise and a black minority very much aware that too many African Americans are still consigned to a ghetto wilderness on the margins of society. Despite the legal and social progress of African Americans since the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, the bitter legacy of slavery and subsequent racial injustice continues to haunt American society.<br><br>Asante pinpoints the greatest source of frustration and anger among African Americans in recent decades: what he calls ""the wall of ignorance"" that attempts to hide the long history of racial injustice from public consciousness. This is most evident in each race's differing perspectives on racial matters. Though most whites view racism as a thing of the past, a social problem largely solved by the Civil Rights movement, blacks continue to experience racism in many areas of social life: encounters with the police; the practice of red lining in housing; difficulties in getting bank loans, mortgages, and insurance policies; and glaring disparities in health care, educational opportunities, unemployment levels, and incarceration rates. Though such problems are not expressions of the overt racism of legal segregation and lynch mobs - what most whites probably think of when they hear the word ""racism"" - their negative effect on black Americans is almost as pernicious. Such daily experiences create a lingering feeling of resentment that percolates in a slow boil till some event triggers an outburst of rage, like the Los Angeles riots of 1992. Only then does the majority start to pay attention.<br><br>Asante argues that America cannot long continue as a cohesive society under these conditions. As we embark upon the new century, he urges more public focus on redressing the wrongs of the past and their continuing legacy. Above all, he thinks that Americans must seriously consider some system of reparations to deal with both past and present injustices, an apology, and our own truth-and-reconciliation committee that addresses both the history of slavery and present-day racism. Only in this way, he feels, can we ever hope to heal the racial divide that never seems to be erased.<br><br>This is a powerful, deeply perceptive analysis of a crucial social problem by one of America's leading thinkers on race. - from Amzon","African-American Studies, Minority Studies, Discrimination & Racism",,,,,,,"E185.615.A8

Life has become meaningless existence, man a cog in a machine. The only way of escape lies in a nonrational fantasy world of experience, drugs, absurdity, pornography, an elusive ""final experience,"" madness . . . .If this is the twentieth-century mentality, how did it come about? And how can the Christian faith be made meaningful today? In this highly original book Dr. Schaeffer traces the way in which art and philosophy have reflected the dualism in Western thinking introduced at the time of the Renaisance. Today this dualism is expressed in a despair of rationality and an escape into a nonrational world which alone offers hope. It is shown in literature, art and music, theatre and cinema, television and popular culture. - from Amzon","Christian Living, Philosophy, Ethics, Theology",,,,,,,"B804.S32,

That is, until a platoon of Navy SEALs, sent to the Philippines to save an American family kidnapped by radical Islamic terrorists, is caught in a deadly ambush. The mission had been top secret -- so who told the enemy? All evidence points to the State Department and the Philippine embassy. But a greater threat still lurks. An unknown assassin working closely with the highest powers in the Middle East is bent on igniting war. Now, with the world watching his every move, will Rapp be able to overcome this anonymous foe and once again keep the flames of war from raging?<BR> <BR>Transporting us into an intriguing geopolitical puzzle full of deadly motives, covert operatives, and all the true-to-life insider detail we've come to expect from Vince Flynn, <i>Executive Power</i> is a high-flying story that delivers shattering suspense with the velocity of a 9mm bullet. - from Amzon","Political, Action & Adventure, United States, Political, Terrorism, Suspense",,,,,,,"PS3556.L94E94,2003"

European philosophers of the Enlightenment such as Jean Jacques Rousseau had begun pressing for democratic reforms in Europe on the basis of glowing reports by early settlers about the New World and its native inhabitants. <br><br>The founding fathers of the United States, in turn, were inspired to fight for independence and to create the great American documents of freedom through contact with Native American statesmen and exposure to American Indian societies based on individual freedom, representative government and the democratic union of tribes. Yet American Indians have never been acknowledged for their many contributions to the founding of the United States of America, and they have never been permitted to fully share the benefits of the freedoms they helped establish. <br><br>Exiled in the Land of the Free is a dramatic recounting of early American history and an eloquent call for reform that will not be ignored. Written by eight prominent Native American leaders and scholars, each a specialist in his area of expertise, Exiled in the Land of the Free: Democracy, Indian Nations and the U. S. Constitution is a landmark volume, sure to be read by generations to come. <br><br>An aspect of American history that has been ignored and denied for centuries is the extent to which we are indebted to Native Americans for the principles and practices on which our democratic institutions are based. This is the first work to recognize that legacy and trace our model of participatory democracy to its Native American roots. This book, which was written into the Congressional Record, has major implications for future relations between Indian tribes and the governments of the United States and other nations. It presents the strongest case ever made for Native American sovereignty. American history has finally been written--not from the European point of view--but from an Indian perspective. Exiled in the Land of the Free has been adopted for courses in twelve universities, to date. - from Amzon","Native American, Colonial Period, Democracy",,,,,,,"E93.E965

Diamond was behind the camera, this technique was an innovative application of art to science, reflecting and expanding the contemporary interest in physiognomic characteristics. In <i>The Face of Madness</i>, notable scholar Sander Gilman has curated a unique exhibition of 54 of Dr. Diamond's photographs and commentary. </p>  <p>Diamond's photographs are eloquent portraits of the insane-the melancholy, the depressed, the deranged, the alcoholic-whom he cared for at the Surrey County Lunatic Asylum. In addition to their psychiatric significance, these photographs are notable works of art since Diamond was a pioneer in experimenting with and refining photographic techniques. </p>  <p>Diamond's paper ""On the Application of Photography to the Physiognomic and Mental Phenomena of Insanity,"" is included in this printing. This discourse discloses three functions of photography which are still relevant to the practice of psychiatry today: Photography can record the appearance of the mentally ill for study; it can be used for treatment through the presentation of an accurate self-image; and it can record the visages of patients to facilitate identification in case of later readmission.</p>  <p>In addition to Diamond's paper, notes and analysis by Dr. John Conolly are also included in this volume. Dr. Conolly, one of Dr. Diamond's associates, was widely considered to be the leading British psychiatrist of the mid-nineteenth century. His patient case studies accompany 17 of Diamond's photographs. These reports include clinical information as well as diagnoses based on the theories of the physiognomy of insanity accepted at that period.</p>  <p><i>The Face of Madness</i> is a book to be treasured not only by psychiatrists, but also by photographers and medical historians. As Eric T. Carlson writes in the Introduction: ""Until now these photographs have been known only through the sketches made from them. Professor Gilman has performed a great service in locating them and by giving us their history.""</p> <p></p>  <p><b>Sander L. Gilman, PhD,</b> is a distinguished professor of the Liberal Arts and Sciences as well as Professor of Psychiatry at Emory University. A respected educator, he has served as Old Dominion Visiting Professor of English at Princeton; Northrop Frye Visiting Professor of Comparative Literature at the University of Toronto; Mellon Visiting Professor of Humanities at Tulane University; Goldwin Smith Professor of Humane Studies at Cornell University; and Professor of the History of Psychiatry at Cornell Medical College. He has written and edited several books including <i>Sexuality: An Illustrated History</i> and <i>Seeing the Insane.</i></p> - from Amzon","Medical Books, General",,,,,,,RC455.2.P5F3

Reginald M. Clark contends, however, that such structural characteristics of families neither predict nor explain the wide variation in academic achievement among children. He emphasizes instead the total family life, stating that the most important indicators of academic potential are embedded in family culture.<br><BR>To support his contentions, Clark offers ten intimate portraits of Black families in Chicago. Visiting the homes of poor one- and two-parent families of high and low achievers, Clark made detailed observations on the quality of home life, noting how family habits and interactions affect school success and what characteristics of family life provide children with ""school survival skills,"" a complex of behaviors, attitudes, and knowledge that are the essential elements in academic success.<br><BR>Clark's conclusions lead to exciting implications for educational policy. If school achievement is not dependent on family structure or income, parents can learn to inculcate school survival skills in their children. Clark offers specific suggestions and strategies for use by teachers, parents, school administrators, and social service policy makers, but his work will also find an audience in urban anthropology, family studies, and Black studies.<br></div> - from Amzon","African-American Studies, Reform & Policy, Parent Participation",,,,,,,LC2801.C56

First, they show a diversity of concerns. These include spirituality, sexuality, the representation of women in art, the necessary inter-relationship of theory and action, women as artmakers, ethnicity, language itself, so-called postfeminism and critiques of hte art world, the discipline of art history and the practice of art criticism. Second, the contributors' work has not been either widely disseminated or readily available. Third, the essays, especially arranged as they are (chronologically), demonstrate a continuous feminist discourse in art from the early 1970s through the present, a discourse that is neither monolithic nor intellectually trendy but that rather exhibits many elements, the polemical, Marxist, lyrical, and poststructuralist being only a few.""</div> - from Amzon","Criticism, Women in Art, New, Used & Rental Textbooks",,,,,,,"HQ1101.R2030.7

Do women's voices yield a distinct approach to the study of ethics?<br><br>Although they're far from uniform, women's voices, shaped by legacies of sexual politics, differ enough from men's to warrant a separate hearing.  In Feminist Ethics  feminist philosopher Claudia Card provides the forum.  She brings together fifteen new essays on the nature, current state, and implications of feminist ethics, including many by some of the best and best known feminist philosophers in the U.S.<br><br>The connecting threads?<br><br>""Feminist ethics is born of women's refusals to endure with grace the arrogance, indifference, hostility, and damage of oppressively sexist environments,"" Card writes.  Thus, woven throughout feminist writings on ethics run experiences of oppression.  From a variety of perspectives the writers of these essays address a fundamental question:  If oppressive contexts shape the moral development of the oppressed, what does it mean for the oppressed to resist, to make morally responsible choices, to become moral agents, to develop character?<br><br>This volume presents no single answer.  Instead, the essays collected here reflect the pluralism and ""feistiness"" of modern feminism.  Subjects range from the history of feminist ethics to the logic of pluralist feminism, presenting feminist perspectives on such unexpected topics as terrorism, bitterness, women trusting other women, and survival and ethics. - from Amzon","Ethics & Morality, Feminist Theory",,,,,,,"BD450.F43

It is designed both as a main text and as a supplementary reader. This third edition includes new sections on feminist research perspectives and methodology, and the state and international politics.

Using vivid examples, this book explores the possibility that psychological methods can be used in a similar way to address subtle energies in mindbody systems and thereby restore health.<br /><br /> The author has presented highly acclaimed seminars on Ericksonian and clinical hypnosis, imagery, and ego-state therapy. Here she adds EMDR, thought field therapy (TFT), and body-focused therapy to the tools that can open inner pathways to healing that have been frozen by stress, past trauma, and developmental issues. Throughout the book she emphasizes the principles of gathering and building on strengths that each client already owns, using tools that provoke energetic flow to dissolve barriers to health, and selecting strategies that utilize the powerful effects of positive expectancy.<br /><br /> In the first four sections, vivid, intriguing stories illustrate how EMDR, hypnosis, imagery, TFT, and body-focused therapy can be used to solve the mysteries of health crises triggered by general stresses and anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and the challenges of organic conditions such as cancer, head injury, arthritis, and cardiac disease. The final section presents three creative models for combining and integrating energy therapies to increase healing possibilities for individuals with complex health situations that do not respond to any one approach.<br /><br /><em>Finding the Energy to Heal</em> is an especially useful guide for professionals interested in cutting-edge methodology as well as for readers seeking solutions to perplexing health challenges.<br /> - from Amzon","Healing, Compulsive Behavior, Counseling, Psychoanalysis, Psychiatry, Counseling, Psychotherapy, TA & NLP, Psychotherapy, Psychopathology",,,,,,,RC489.M53P475

The mathematical integrity of the previous edition has been maintained in the new edition. The core topics and their applications are presented in Parts One and Two of this text, and additional applications are developed in Part Three. Parts One and Two are independent of one another, thus either probability or linear mathematics may be studied first. The authors' emphasis is on developing and testing the student's problem-solving ability. They use discussions and examples to illustrate ideas and techniques to aid the student in acquiring these skills. Some examples and exercises are straightforward computation, while others require that the problem be solved by combining several techniques. Since it is impossible to provide examples of every type of problem the student will encounter in the text, the authors have identified and treated the fundamental principles that should be used in unfamiliar situations. - from Amzon","Mathematical Analysis, Calculus, Finite Mathematics, Calculus",,,,,,,"QA39.2.M333

responsibilities of the chief academic officer—now more often called vice
president for academic affairs or provost than the traditional academic
dean— First Among Equals addresses the need for vision and leadership by
these individuals in an increasingly complex higher education environment.
Contributors to this landmark volume—all present or former chief academic
officers—conclude that the most effective leaders combine high levels of
managerial acumen with professional scholarship while challenging their
institutions to provide effective programs for complex and demanding
constituencies. Each chapter of First Among Equals explores a different
aspect of the chief academic officer's primary responsibilities, including
relations with the president and the board, academic governance, curriculum
development, new instructional technologies, enrollment management, legal
affairs, and faculty development, among others. As higher education
institutions compete to unprecedented degrees for the brightest students
and the most accomplished faculty, First Among Equals provides much needed
guidance for those who occupy or aspire to this position, both in
understanding its expanding number of tasks and becoming expert at
performing them. Contributors: Roy A. Austenson, Michael Baer, James

A disciplined, gentle man who upheld the old ways, he was aggrieved by the social ills he saw besetting his own people and forthright in denouncing them. When he died in 1989 at the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, he was widely loved and respected. <P><I>Fools Crow</I> is based on interviews conducted in the 1970s. The holy man tells Thomas E. Mails about his eventful life, from early reservation days when the Sioux were learning to farm, to later times when alcoholism, the cash economy, and World War II were fast eroding the old customs. He describes his vision quests and his becoming a medicine man. His spiritual life—the Yuwipi and sweatlodge ceremonies, the Sun Dance, and instances of physical healing—is related in memorable detail. And because Fools Crow lived joyfully in this world, he also recounts his travels abroad and with Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, his happy marriages, his movie work, and his tribal leadership. He lived long enough to mediate between the U.S. government and Indian activists at Wounded Knee in 1973 and to plead before a congressional subcommittee for the return of the Black Hills to his people.</P></DIV> - from Amzon","Ethnic & National, Native American, United States, Native American Studies, Biographies & Memoirs, Native American, Native American Studies",,,,,,,"E99.03F664

can be adjusted to the analysis of complex organizations. The book provides
a holistic perspective of a Japanese bank and its more than 3,000
employees. Methodologically, Rohlen analyzed this bank in much the same
fashion as he would have carried out the study of a small community. Eleven
months of participant observation within the bank and among its employees
after work provided the major source of data. . . Possibly the most
important finding of the study is that despite surface similarities with
banks throughout the world, the Japanese have evolved an institution which
is radically different. This bank, like many modern Japanese businesses, is
organized to secure a common livelihood and way of life for its employees .
. . more than the best cultural analysis of a Japanese business, for the
book also contributes to the fields of Japanese cultural change and
modernization process essential reading.""--American Anthropologist ""The
account is adorned with an unusually rich selection of illustration from
the speeches of firm officers, company records and documents, and of course
extensive observations from employees . . . As a case study of a single
Japanese organization, For Harmony and Strength is a superb effort that
penetrates deeper than any other book in the English language.""--
Contemporary Sociology ""A first-rate contribution to the literature in
applied anthropology and comparative and cross-cultural management for the
insights it provides on management of white-collar employees in Japan.""--
Industrial and Labor Relations Review ""A well-written, thoroughly
researched study of the internal life of a single Japanese organization . .
Unlike most previous writers, Aohlen deals with the separate recruitment,
work, and leisure patterns of the bank's women employees. As an
anthropologist he has particular sensitivity to the ritual meanings of bank
songs, ceremonies, and extensive training activities . . . one of the best
analyses to date of how Japanese organization works.""--Library Journal
""What emerges from Rohlen's convincing and penetrating analysis is a
picture of a thoroughly 'Japanese' business organization deeply imbued with
Japanese cultural values .. . . in its sensitivity to cultural meanings and
in its analytical coherence in the presentation of data, this book is a
model of scholarship matched by few ethnographies. It will be consulted by
those specializing in Japan, those interested in organizational behavior,
and those interested in seeing 'the meanings of fundamental matters, ' for

This book explores some of his key ideas and concepts in relation to a variety of education contexts and issues. It argues that schools, like prisons and asylums, are often artificial and highly disciplined environments and provide excellent case studies for Foucalt's concern with the technologies of power and domination and the arbitrariness of modern institutions. The essays in this collection approach the subject in different and original ways. Three use historical material to explore aspects of the constitution of modern education. Three examine the role of discourse about education in the contemporary politics of education - the discursive work of the ""New Right"" is of particular interest.

methodologies and theoretical frameworks that are new to them. The text is
distinguished by its avoidance of using the discreet categories of
qualitative and quantitative methods to organize the chapters. While some
chapter authors rely more on one or the other, many employ multiple
methodologies to investigate particular problems and questions. Further,
the book is not organized into single, contradictory positivist-
interpretivist categories of research; chapter authors often situate
methodologies within a variety of, and sometimes multiple, theoretical
positions, particularly as these approaches are shaped by the historical
context of social science research. Focus points in Foundations for

*research ethics. *intertwined relationship of theory and research design.

Phil Harper contends that the fragmentation considered to be characteristic of the postmodern age can in fact be traced to the status of marginalized groups in the United States since long before the contemporary era. This status is reflected in the work of American writers from the thirties through the fifties whom Harper addresses in this study, including Nathanael West, Anaïs Nin, Djuna Barnes, Ralph Ellison, and Gwendolyn Brooks. Treating groups that are disadvantaged or disempowered whether by circumstance of gender, race, or sexual orientation, the writers profiled here occupy the cusp between the modern and the postmodern; between the recognizably modernist aesthetic of alienation and the fragmented, disordered sensibility of postmodernism. Proceeding through close readings of these literary texts in relation to various mass-cultural productions, Harper examines the social placement of the texts in the scope of literary history while analyzing more minutely the interior effects of marginalization implied by the fictional characters enacting these narratives. In particular, he demonstrates how these works represent the experience of social marginality as highly fractured and fracturing, and indicates how such experience is implicated in the phenomenon of postmodernist fragmentation. Harper thus accomplishes the vital task of recentering cultural focus on issues and groups that are decentered by very definition, and thereby specifies the sociopolitical significance of postmodernism in a way that has not yet been done.<br> - from Amzon","Postmodernism, United States, Social Sciences, American Literature, Europe",,,,,,,"PS228.P68H37

Curt Wilcox knew old cars, and he knew immediately that this one was...wrong, just wrong. A few hours later, when Rafferty vanished, Wilcox and his fellow troopers knew the car was worse than dangerous -- and that it would be better if John Q. Public never found out about it.

Curt's avid curiosity taking the lead, they investigated as best they could, as much as they dared. Over the years the troop absorbed the mystery as part of the background to their work, the Buick 8 sitting out there like a still life painting that breathes -- inhaling a little bit of this world, exhaling a little bit of whatever world it came from.

In the fall of 2001, a few months after Curt Wilcox is killed in a gruesome auto accident, his 18-year-old boy Ned starts coming by the barracks, mowing the lawn, washing windows, shoveling snow. Sandy Dearborn, Sergeant Commanding, knows it's the boy's way of holding onto his father, and Ned is allowed to become part of the Troop D family. One day he looks in the window of Shed B and discovers the family secret. Like his father, Ned wants answers, and the secret begins to stir, not only in the minds and hearts of the veteran troopers who surround him, but in Shed B as well....

From a Buick 8 is a novel about our fascination with deadly things, about our insistence on answers when there are none, about terror and courage in the face of the unknowable. - from Amzon",,,,,,,,"PS3561.I483F76

Twenty years after they let it, Rupert and his father Philip, accompanied by Philip's young wife Kirsti and their chauffeur Rajiv, return to India to make peace with their past. The little troupe proceeds by car through the bleak industrial suburbs of town they no longer recognize, a tour whose ultimate stop will be a visit to the grave of Rupert's mother. The heat and dust, the poverty of the peasants, and the hostility of the merchants all create a feeling of oppression that heightens the sense of loss felt by father and son. But beneath the surface there is another source of tension among the group of travellers-the barely suppressed sexual attraction Rupert feels toward his father's wife, in counterpoint to his growing sense of betrayal as recollections of the past, and of the mother who died when he was so young, accumulate. Through Rupert's point of view we see his father as frail, politely ineffectual, even a bit dotty-until the gradual revelations of the past merge with those of the present, and Philip reveals his own complex truth in the novel's surprising and powerful climax. - from Amzon",,,,,,,,"PR6061.145F56

After losing both her father and brother before turning 17, Julie faces fire, flood, grifters, sickness, and starvation with grim determination and remarkable stamina. By capturing the earthy details of rural life, including raw, riveting accounts of everything from hog slaughtering to childbirth, Robert Morgan weaves the human and the heroic that coexist in every individual.

There is a most unusual woman living in Gap Creek. Julie Harmon works hard, ""hard as a man,"" they say, so hard that at times she's not sure she can stop. People depend on her to slaughter the hogs and nurse the dying. People are weak, and there is so much to do. She is just a teenager when her little brother dies in her arms. That same year she marries and moves down into the valley where floods and fire and visions visit themselves on her, and con men and drunks and lawyers come calling. Julie and her husband discover that the modern world is complex and that it grinds ever on without pause or concern for their hard work. To survive, they must find out whether love can keep chaos and madness at bay. Robert Morgan's latest novel, Gap Creek, returns his readers to the vivid world of the Appalachian high country. Julie and Hank's new life in the valley of Gap Creek in the last years of the nineteenth century is more complicated than the couple ever imagined. Sometimes it's hard to tell what to fear most-the fires and floods or the flesh-and-blood grifters, drunks, and busybodies who insinuate themselves into their new lives. Their struggles with nature, with work, with the changing century, and with their disappointments and triumphs make this a riveting follow-up to Morgan's acclaimed novel, The Truest - from Amzon",,,,,,,,"PS3563.087147G36

Though, as she admits, her status as an  adult and an observer may have affected what happened around her, Thorne  presents a fascinating account of how children divide themselves--and  how others divide them--along gender lines. Breaking students into teams  for contests and the eternal game of ""cooties"" (a contamination  attributed more often to girls than boys) reveal much about the  microcosm that these students inhabit, and an extensive look at the  tomboy, both in literature and in life, compares her ambiguity  (sometimes an insult, sometimes a compliment) to the negative attitudes  often elicited by gender-crossing in the other direction. Thorne argues  convincingly against the theories of scholars like Deborah Tannen and  Carol Gilligan that boys and girls have different ""cultures,"" and she  attempts to discourage ""gender antagonism."" A final section offers  concrete steps for teachers to take in forming the attitudes--about  gender and other topics--of coming generations.</div> - from Amzon","Social Sciences, Women's Studies, Philosophy & Social Aspects, Specialty Boutique, Social Sciences, Women's Studies, Teacher Resources",,,,,,,LC212.92.T46

It immerses readers in the human dilemmas teachers face when they set out to provide equal opportunities for -- and to develop the abilities of -- all of their students. Each case, a true but disguised situation, presents the pedagogical concerns, ethical questions, competing values, and complexity of social change teachers face on a daily basis in their classrooms. These cases help readers to identify and understand ideas and issues by relating them to both their own and others' real-life experiences. The book includes activities and discussion questions to involve readers in critical thinking about the issues raised in the cases and in applying this knowledge to their own current or future classroom practice.<br> <br> Using a casebook approach, the text is organized in five sections. Designed to help readers explore the issues raised by contextualizing them in stories that are authentic and engaging, it emphasizes the teacher's role as a skilled professional who thinks critically and makes decisions, and creates lively and involved class discussion by making room for students with diverse perspectives.<br> - from Amzon","Schools & Teaching, Education",,,,,,,LC65.S245

During 1905 and 1906, Geronimo, the legendary Apache warrior and honorary war chief, dictated his story through a native interpreter to S.M. Barrett, then superintendent of schools in Lawton, Oklahoma. As Geronimo was by then a prisoner of war, Barrett had made appeals all the way up the chain of command to President Teddy Roosevelt for permission to record the words of the “Indian outlaw.” Geronimo came to each interview knowing exactly what he wanted to cover, beginning with his telling of the Apache creation story. When, at the end of the first session, Barrett posed a question, the only answer he received was a pronouncement—“Write what I have spoken.”<br>  <br> Now Geronimo’s narrative, with S.M.

The FDI is revisited and as well. A second important development has been the growing tide of protests against globalization.

One day, Greedy Woman cut of an enormous chunk of the sky and, even with the help of the whole village, there was no way to finish it so she had to throw the remainder away. The sky was angry about this and rose high above the Earth so the people could no longer take pieces for food. Now people must work for their food."" Greedy Woman, the Nigerian goddess responsible for humans having to work for their living is just one of the many thousands of women who populate world mythology. In every culture throughout the ages, women have played an intricate part in the mythical traditions that make up the voices of generations past. Yet, despite the rich diversity of these figures, researchers, archaeologists, and linguists have tended to give them short shrift.<br>    Covering 30,000 years of goddess worship, this fascinating book is the first and most comprehensive biographical dictionary devoted exclusively to mythological women. Offering unprecedented access to information on over 11,000 goddesses, nymphs, demons, and deified women, this around the world journey explores hundreds of cultures that have worshiped female divinities. There are both the famous and the obscure--from Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love and beauty, and the Indian goddess Nari, creator of life, to Nermain, one of the five Irish war goddesses who provoke warriors to madness in battle, and Sodza, African goddess of thunder whose loud noise drives away evil spirits. Arranged alphabetically within fifteen geographical regions, including Egypt, the Far East, Oceania, North America, and the Himalayan region, each entry identifies the goddess by her most common anthropological, mythological, or religious name. It then identifies the culture recognizing that goddess, summarizies her powers or attributes, and often, provides a brief story characterizing her personality, motivations, powers, and attributes. Here are goddesses responsible for every aspect of daily life: we read of the agricultural attributes of the goddess Siduri, a Near Eastern goddess of wine and wisdom who encourages her followers to eat, drink, and be merry; we meet Lea, the Polynesian goddess of canoe makers, responsible for commerce and travel; and we are introduced to the Sjofn, the Scandinavian goddess of sexuality responsible for stirring human hearts to love. Included also are over 2,000 cross-references that guide the reader to other entries, showing the surprisingly intricate relationship of certain goddesses across cultures, regions, and time, as well as two indexes that divide the goddesses by name and attribute.<br>    A unique and easy-to-use guide to female deities, <em>Goddesses in World Mythology</em> shows that goddessess were not just wives, sisters, mothers, or fertility deities, but supreme deities themselves. Ranging from Lennaxidaq, the Native American goddess of luck and wealth to gSum-brag-ma, Tibet's malevolent goddess of dysentery, this exhaustive work returns feminine sacredness to an honored place in the archives of humanity. - from Amzon","Classics, Fairy Tales, Reference, Comparative Religion, Theology, Folklore & Mythology, Women's Studies",,,,,,,"BL473.5.A66

Viewing these archtypes as the inner counterparts of the outer world of cultural stereotypes, she demonstrates how men an women can gain an nvaluable sense of wholeness and integration when what they do is consistent with who they are. Dr. Bolen introduces these patterns in the guise of eight archetypal gods, or personality types, with whom the reader will identify. From the authoritarian power-seeking gods (Zeus, Poseidon) to the gods of creativity (Apollo, Hephaestus) to the sensual Dionysus, Dr. Bolen shows men how to identify their ruling gods, how to decide which to cultivate and which to overcome, and how to tap thepwer of these enduring archetypes in order to enrich and strengthen their lives. She also stresses the importance of understanding which gods you are attracted to and which are compatible with your expectations, uncovers the origins of the often-difficult father-son relationship, and explores society's deep conflict between nurturing behavior and the need to foster masculinity.<p>In <em>Gods in Everyman </em>Dr. Bolen presents us with a compassionate and lucid male psychology that will help all men and women to better understand themselves and their relationships with their fathers, their sons, their brothers, and their lovers.<p><br /> - from Amzon","Psychology & Counseling, New Thought, General, Folklore & Mythology, Men",,,,,,,"BF692.5B64

Jaunty, outspoken, and unable to suffer fools, Rizka is the kind of person everyone in town has strong feelings about--she is either loved or despised. Since no one can ever get the better of her, certain ""respectable"" citizens of their small old-world hamlet want to rid the town of the troublemaker. If only someone had the brains to think up something that could do the trick.  Laced with laughs throughout, the novel is told through episodically linked chapters about the absurd inhabitants of the town and their interactions with Rizka. Full of foibles, farce, fun-poking, and buffoonery, it is high comedy as much as a celebration of Rizka's brains and brassiness, her flouting of conventions, and her own brand of magic. Despite the foolishness, the book is infused with Alexander's recognition and respect for the rich and good heart of its main character and the human truth of accepting others' differences. - from Amzon","Action & Adventure, Humor",,,,,,,"PZ7.A3774Gy

Before the market reopens on Monday, you’re going to have to scramble and scheme to cover your butt, but there’s no way you can anticipate the baffling disappearance of a 300-pound psychic, the fall from grace of a born-again monkey, or the intrusion in your life of a tattooed stranger intent on blowing your mind and most of your fuses. Over these fateful three days, you will be forced to confront everything from mysterious African rituals to legendary amphibians, from tarot-card bombshells to street violence, from your own sexuality to outer space.

tempo giusto 'the right tempo.' It means a steady, normal heat, between 66
and 76 on the metronome. Tempo giusto is the appropriate heat of the human
heart."" One of the preeminent literary artists of our time turns her
attention, her profound insight, and her passion to humankind's most
enduring, important, evocative, and provocative symbol: What is heart? It
is the muscle of life, sending our most vital fluid coursing through our
veins to every striving hungry part of our being. It is what keeps us
striving against impossible odds; that fortifying something that is the
cornerstone of every triumph. It elates us when we discover love and pains
us greatly when that love is lost or proves unrequited. It is a gentleness
that colors what we give to others. It is a symbol that we see on greeting
cards: a small, red shape that was drawn on the wall of a cave in Spain
more than 12,000 years ago In this truly remarkable work, acclaimed,
bestselling author Gall Godwin takes us on a breathtaking journey of the
heart that spans the entire history of human civilization, combining
literature, myth, religion, philosophy, medicine, the fine arts, and
intensely personal stories from the writer's own past to explore the full
and complex character of that unique symbol. Brimming with intelligence and
wit, Godwin's explorations and meditations brilliantly track themes of the
heart in life, legend, and art -- from the first valentine to the first
stethoscope, from Gilgamesh to Confucius, from the heart of darkness to
wearing one is heart on one's sleeve. Here is a gift of the heart from an
eminent American writer at the pinnacle of her creative talents. It is a
work of extraordinary power, creativity, scholarship, and passion. Lively
and moving, Heart offers us a profound new look at where we come from and
what has sustained us across millennia-in short, what it is that makes us
human.","Essays, Customs & Traditions",,,,,,,"GR489.4.G63

It's a brilliant, fast-paced tale, electric with sexual tension, by one of America's most popular authors of sophisticated suspense. <P> For Paris Gibson, her popular late-night radio show is both an escape and her one real contact with the outside world. <P> Since moving to Austin to ease the pain of past, tragic mistakes, she has led a life of virtual solitude, coming alive only when she hosts her show. To her loyal listeners, she is a wise and trusted friend who not only takes their music requests but listens to their problems and occasionally dispenses advice.  <P> Paris's world of isolation is brutally threatened, however, when one listener -- a man who identifies himself only as ""Valentino"" -- tells her that her on-air advice to the girl he loves has caused her to leave him and that now he intends to exact his revenge. First he plans to kill the girl, whom he has abducted -- which he says he will do in 72 hours -- then he will come after Paris.  <P> Joined by the Austin police department, Paris plunges into a race against time in an effort to find Valentino before he can carry out his threat to kill -- and to kill again. To her dismay, she finds that one of the people she must work with is crime psychologist Dean Malloy, a man with whom she shares a history that had a catastrophic effect on both their lives. His presence arouses old passions, forcing Paris to confront painful memories that she had come to Austin to forget. <P> As the clock ticks down, and Valentino's threats come closer and closer to becoming a reality, Paris suddenly finds herself forced to deal with a killer who may not be a stranger at all. <P> Tense and compelling right up to the chilling climax, Hello, Darkness is suspense at its very best, by the author <I>USA Today</I> has called ""a masterful storyteller, carefully crafting tales that keep readers on the edge of their seats."" - from Amzon",,,,,,,,"PS3552.R718H45

As more and more tests are introduced into the country's schools, it becomes increasingly important to know how those tests are used--and misused--in assessing children's performance and achievements.<br> <b>High Stakes</b> focuses on how testing is used in schools to make decisions about tracking and placement, promotion and retention, and awarding or withholding high school diplomas.

The development of the biological sciences opened the way for vitalism and an interest in the philosophy of life, while the philosophy of history came into renewed emphasis with the names of Weber, Spengler, and Toynbee. Pragmatism and materialism, realism and naturalism, all vie for our attention. And if we are met with a revivalism of scholasticism, the philosophy of Bergson and the appearance of the phenomenology of Husserl and others represent fresh approaches to speculative life. The Post-Colonial Age, Professor Caponigri believes, is an era ""hungry for philosophy, deeply in need of it, and conscious of this need."" The great number of philosophical positions in evidence support this view, although we may not be able to characterize the philosophical spirit of the age in an easy formula. Existentialism and contemporary spiritualism are found alongside language analysis. In the early part of this period were found philosophies of action as well as reactions to positivism: absolute historicism and actual idealism. This variety of philosophical concern may stamp our age as one genuinely philosophical in it quality. - from Amzon",,,,,,,,"B108.R5802

Sample transcripts of conferences with elementary and middle school students in both urban and suburban settings walk us through the process step by step, providing new insight into how ambitious conferences unfold. <p> Above all, <i>How's It Going?</i> is a practical book. Written in a conversational style, it's filled with lots of useful advice, including an in-depth discussion of the teacher's role in conferences, strategies for teaching students to take an active role, ways to weave in literature, minilessons, classroom management strategies, and responses to the most frequently asked questions about conferring. Along the way, readers will learn new ways of thinking, develop effective techniques, and perfect straightforward strategies. At the same time, they'll grasp the art and logic of conferring, and with this learning in mind, discover for themselves how to confer well. - from Amzon","Children's Books, Study & Teaching, Assessment, Language Arts, Certification & Development, Elementary Education",,,,,,,LB1576.A6159 2000

No generalization can hold true for all the classical poems of North American Indians. They spring from thirty thousand years of experience, five hundred languages and dialects, and ten linguistic groups and general cultures. But the poems from these different cultures and languages belong to poetry unified by similar experiences and shared continent.<BR><BR>Built on early transcriptions of Native American “songs” and arranged by subject, these poems are informed by additional context that enables readers to appreciate more fully their imagery, their cultural basis, and the moment that produced them. They let us look at our continent through the eyes of a wide range of people: poets, hunters, farmers, holy men and women, and children. This poetry achieved its vividness, clarity, and intense emotional powers partly because the singers made their poems for active use as well as beauty, and also because they made them for singing or chanting rather than isolated reading.<BR><BR>Most striking, classical North American Indian poetry brings us flashes of timeless vision and absolute perception: a gull’s wing red over the dawn; snow-capped peaks in the moonlight; a death song. Flowing beneath them is a powerful current: the urge to achieve a selfless attention to the universe and a determination to see and delight in the universe on its own terms.</DIV> - from Amzon","Criticism & Theory, Poetry, Anthologies, Native American, Native American Studies",,,,,,,"PM197.E312

In America and Britain, an era of weary consensus was displaced by the arrival of a political marriage of fiery idealists: Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher transformed politics with a combination of breezy charm and assertive ""Victorian values."" In Iran, the fundamentalist cleric Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini set out to restore a regime that had last existed almost 1,300 years ago. Between them they succeeded in bringing the twentieth century to a premature close. By 1989, Francis Fukuyama was declaring that we had now reached the End of History.<br><br> What colonized the space recently vacated by notions of history, progress and reason? Cults, quackery, gurus, irrational panics, moral confusion and an epidemic of idiocy, the proof of which was to be found in every state, every work-place, and every library. In <i>Idiot Proof</i> , columnist Francis Wheen brilliantly evokes the key personalities of the post-political era—including Princess Diana and Deepak Chopra, Osama bin Laden and Nancy Reagan's astrologer—while lamenting the extraordinary rise in superstition, relativism and emotional hysteria over the past quarter of a century.<br><br> In turn comic, indignant, outraged and just plain baffled by the idiocy of it all, <i>Idiot Proof</i> is a masterful depiction of the daftness of our times and a plea that we might just think a little more and believe a little less.</div> - from Amzon","Essays, World, National",,,,,,,"B105.T54W48

textbooks, or testing--it's teachers. And when it comes to improving
learning, research has shown teachers what works. But the real challenge
comes when it's time to do what works and do it well. In this book, Jane E.
Pollock explains how making the right adjustments in four critical areas of
practice--curriculum, instruction, assessment, and feedback--can help any
teacher improve student learning significantly. Here, you'll find out how
to -- Create a classroom curriculum document that's truly useful and
incorporates robust concepts, generalizations, and procedures. -- Plan
instruction that's focused on helping students become master learners who
can apply information and skills, not just do schoolwork. -- Design varied
classroom assessments that yield evidence of mastery and pinpoint where
further instruction is required. -- Use criterion-based feedback to improve
individual student achievement and refine instruction. Along with step-by-
step procedures, practical guidelines, and specific models, this book
features the voices of individual teachers who share their experience using

Chapter 2 is a one–hour tour of the universe that emphasizes the diversity of viewpoints from which the universe can be encountered as well as the diversity of objects which it contains. Chapter 3 is concerned with the history of science and describes two contrasting styles in science: one welcoming diversity and the other deploring it. He uses the cities of Manchester and Athens as symbols of these two ways of approaching science. Chapter 4, concerned with the origin of life, describes the ideas of six illustrious scientists who have struggled to understand the nature of life from various points of view. Chapter 5 continues the discussion of the nature and evolution of life. The question of why life characteristically tends toward extremes of diversity remains central in all attempts to understand life's place in the universe.

(Rudy von Bitter)",,,,Birkhäuser,1st,1982,,,eng,,NON FICTION,,Book,"<br>   <p>In <i>Infinity and the Mind,</i> Rudy Rucker leads an excursion to that stretch of the universe he calls the ""Mindscape,"" where he explores infinity in all its forms: potential and actual, mathematical and physical, theological and mundane. Rucker acquaints us with Gödel's rotating universe, in which it is theoretically possible to travel into the past, and explains an interpretation of quantum mechanics in which billions of parallel worlds are produced every microsecond. It is in the realm of infinity, he maintains, that mathematics, science, and logic merge with the fantastic. By closely examining the paradoxes that arise from this merging, we can learn a great deal about the human mind, its powers, and its limitations.</p><br>   <p>Using cartoons, puzzles, and quotations to enliven his text, Rucker guides us through such topics as the paradoxes of set theory, the possibilities of physical infinities, and the results of Gödel's incompleteness theorems. His personal encounters with Gödel the mathematician and philosopher provide a rare glimpse at genius and reveal what very few mathematicians have dared to admit: the transcendent implications of Platonic realism.</p><br> - from Amzon",,,,,,,,"QA9.R79

Cialdini combines evidence from experimental work with the techniques and strategies he gathered while working as a salesperson, fundraiser, advertiser, and other positions, inside organizations that commonly use compliance tactics to get us to say ""yes."" Widely used in graduate and undergraduate psychology and management classes, as well as sold to people operating successfully in the business world, the eagerly awaited revision of Influence reminds the reader of the power of persuasion. Cialdini organizes compliance techniques into six categories based on psychological principles that direct human behavior: reciprocation, consistency, social proof, liking, authority, and scarcity. New Reader's Reports are included in the Fourth Edition and illustrate how readers have used one of the principles or have had a principle of influence used on them. - from Amzon","Self-Help, Marketing, Mental Health, Applied Psychology, Behavioral Sciences, Psychiatry, Applied Psychology, General, Marketing, Mental Health, Psychology",,,,,,,"BF774.C53

The goals of the text and its companion web site are to enable faculty to teach the fundamentals of hardware and software, and more important, to educate their students about how technology can be integrated into instruction. Using the text and web site, students learn to apply knowledge from their content methods courses and learn how to incorporate technology to promote effective instruction.What sets this text apart is its teacher-tested model, The Technology and Learning Continuum Model (TLC), which bridges the gap between educational technology and instructional design. In use by Recesso for more than six years, the model grew out of a Preparing Tomorrow's Teachers to Use Technology (PT3) grant and is being used currently in Georgia to meet the state-mandated requirement that all teachers complete a technology certification program by 2006. The model, however, is not state-specific.Using the 4-color model as a guide, students are able to move beyond awareness of instructional and assistive technology to advanced levels of technology integration. In a structured fashion, pre-service or in-service teachers learn how to align learning activities, objectives, instructional strategies, technology, and assessments to facilitate a progression of student learning. The results are learning units and learning activities where technology is integrated, not used as an add-on, and lesson plans that prospective or current teachers can take into the classroom and effectively use as a guide to instruction. Another important feature of this program is its close alignment with the prevailing technology standards. In these standards-driven times, showing explicitly how content ties to standards is critical. - from Amzon","Education & Reference, Science & Technology, Economics, Education",,,,,,,LB1028.5.R345 2008

But the difficulties of transferring words to paper can be daunting enough to drown out even the most enthusiastic voice. Enter interactive writing, a new instructional approach in which teachers and children collaborate to produce a written text. Just as Fountas and Pinnell did in their best-selling <i>Guided Reading</i>, the authors offer powerful first teaching designed to accelerate and support children's critical understanding of the writing process. <p> <i>Interactive Writing</i> is specifically focused on the early phases of writing, and has special relevance to prekindergarten, kindergarten, grade 1 and 2 teachers. In a clear, step-by-step format, the authors show how teachers can use interactive writing to teach a range of foundational literacy skills by sharing the pen with young writers: <ul> <li>letter learning <li>phonological and orthographic awareness <li>learning the nature of words <li>building a writing vocabulary <li>learning concepts about print <li>organizing and composing narrative and expository text. </ul> Important features include a rich array of examples of children's writing, down-to-earth practical advice, suggestions for using children's literature and art in the writing program, numerous photos of children's work, and suggestions for professional development. Additionally, there are thorough descriptions of how interactive writing can be used as a tool for inquiry across the curriculum - in content areas as well as in literature. With this kind of broad application, children can grow to see writing as a lifelong tool for learning - and see themselves as writers, right from the start. <p> The book is filled with practical information on how to get started with interactive writing, with explicit details from specific materials to fine teaching points. - from Amzon","Children's Books, Study & Teaching, Language Arts, Reading & Phonics, Early Childhood Education, Elementary Education",,,,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=V3buAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"LB1139.5.L35M35

The authors introduce functions in Chapter 3 and do a very thorough treatment, devoting the entire chapter to the concept of functions. With such a solid foundation to build from, students will experience greater success when they encounter other function-related topics in later chapters, such as polynomial functions; quadratic functions; radical functions; and others. The authors have crafted the exercise sets with the idea of infusing review. In each set of practice exercises, instructors will find a set of exercises that help students to review concepts previously learned, and in this way, students will retain more of what they have learned. The exercise sets also contain ""translation"" exercises which provide students with an opportunity to convert from English phrases to mathematical symbols and from mathematical symbols to English phrases, thus helping students to strengthen their command of mathematical language. Moreover, the applications found in the exercise sets are based on real-world data, which helps to promote students' interest in mathematics, and in turn, may serve to motivate and engage them. Other features include mid-chapter reviews and classroom activities (classroom activities are worksheets that can be downloaded from the OLC or distributed by instructors since the classroom activities can be found in the IRM as well). The classroom activities are of special value, in that through their use, students may begin to take greater ownership over their own learning.

Hill,,,,McGraw-Hill Irwin,4,2003,,,,,NON FICTION,,Book,"Market-defining since it was first introduced, International Business, 4e by Charles W. L. Hill, continues to set the standard for international business textbooks. Charles Hill’s reputation as a leading thinker and actor in the international arena precede him, and he is regularly asked to explain world economic events on National Public Radio. His expertise lends itself to a book that is thorough and up-to-date. Because many issues in international business are complex, they necessitate exploration of pros and cons of economic theories, government policies, business strategies, organizational structures, etc. The author challenges the often shallow explanations that other books offer, while maintaining a tight integrated flow between the chapters. Hill’s book is practical in nature, focusing on managerial implications of each topic on the actual practice of international business. The author’s passion and enthusiasm for the international business arena is apparent on every page as he strives to make important theories interesting, informative, and accessible to all students. - from Amzon","International, Management, World",,,,,,,"HD62.4.H55

Its cross-disciplinary approach integrates coverage of international economics, business strategy, government policy, global politics, economic theory and industrial policy in order to provide a practical yet sophisticated framework for managing international competition. The work explores the chief sources of international competitive advantage available to firms - country environments, government policies and firm capabilities - and provides students with an understanding of key institutions and regulations of international commerce, such as the GATT and US trade law. In this edition, 15 of the 30 cases are new. They address such topics as the emergence of global competition, the role of cross-border alliances, the rise of regional free-trade areas and the impact of industrial policy. They also focus more on non-American firms, with detailed material on foreign country conditions and government policies. - from Amzon","Economics, International, Management & Leadership, International Business",,,,,,,"HD62.4.Y64

But unlike other human universals--language, tool use, the family--art makes no material contribution to mankind's survival. What impels the artist to the lonely effort at self-expression? What moves the audience to resonate to the work of a master? What accounts for the child's inherent fascination with pictures and stories and songs?</p><p>These questions are among the deepest we can ask about human nature. Freud deemed some of them forever unanswerable, but modern psychology has made new inroads into these old mysteries. <i>Invented Worlds</i> provides a complete, authoritative account of this progress. Dealing with the three major art forms--painting, music, and literature--Ellen Winner shows how the artist fashions a symbolic world that transforms the experience of the observer. She probes the adult's ability to create and respond to works of art. In addition, she examines children's art for what it can reveal about the artistic impulse before adult convention becomes a shaping force. Finally, in order to reach a better understanding of the biological bases of artistry, Winner discusses the art of the mentally disturbed and the neurologically impaired patient.</p><p>The sum of these discussions is more than an up-to-date handbook to the field; it is nothing less than a new synthesis of our understanding of man's artistic nature. Written with admirable clarity, <i>Invented Worlds</i> is a book that can be used by professionals and students in psychology, education, and the arts, as well as anyone with reason to be curious about the processes that underlie the creation and enjoyment of art.</p> - from Amzon","Arts & Photography, Psychology & Counseling, General, Psychology",,,,,,,"NX165.W5

I wanted a perfect ending. Now I've learned the hard way that some poems don't rhyme, and some stories don't have a clear beginning, middle, and end.""<p>The world fondly remembers the many faces of Gilda Radner: the adamant but misinformed Emily Litella; the hyperkinetic Girl Scout Judy Miller; the irrepressibly nerdy Lisa Loopner; the gross-out queen of local network news, Rosanne Rosannadanna. A supremely funny performer, Gilda lost a long and painful struggle in May 1989 to ""the most unfunny thing in the world""--cancer. But the face she showed the world during this dark time was one of great courage and hope. <i>It's Always Something</i> is the story of her struggle told in Gilda's own remarkable words--a personal chronicle of strength and indomitable spirit and love undiminished by the cruel ravages of disease.<p>This is Gilda, with whom we laughed on Saturday Night Live: warm, big-hearted, outrageous, and real.

Fisk's selections show that in the ground-breaking work now being done, there is a unity of ethical and political considerations. Theoretical concerns and studies of practical justice are also addressed. The editor incorporates high theory as expounded by figures like Rawls and Habermas, as well as applications to issues of race, gender, law, ecology and class. Since the 19th century intellectual background is important for studying current developments in justice, J S Mill, Marx and T H Green are also included to represent the current of social change from that time. Finally, recent debates on whether justice can be colour- or gender-blind are represented in the writings of a number of known African-American and women writers. The anthology focuses on applied issues. It should be of interest to students taking courses in political philosophy, political theory, ethics, social theory and intellectual history.

Ewing,,,,Harvard Business School Press,1st,1989,,,,,NON FICTION,,Book,"After years of relinquishing their civil rights at the office or plant door, nonunion workers in America are now looking for a form of due process at work-or failing that, in the courts. Justice on the Job heralds a small but growing trend toward effective in-house procedures designed to handle employee complaints and head off litigation. It is more than just a coincidence that some of the companies enjoying the greatest measure of employee commitment are companies that also maintain successful nonunion grievance procedures. Such a system-whether it takes the form of the investigators at CIGNA in Philadelphia, Federal Express's dual system in Los Angeles-represents a net gain for the organization seeking to reduce Litigation costs, avoid unions, reinforce personnel policy, and, in general, do the right thing by employees. Justice on the Job shows ""how to tell due process when you see it,"" outlines the benefits and pitfalls of different systems, explores why due process works, examines what can go wrong, and recommends what kinds of systems to establish. Ewing provides detailed case studies of corporate justice systems such as ""Let's Talk"" at Bank of America, ""The Open Door"" at IBM, Control Data's ""Review Board,"" and SmithKline Beckman's grievance procedure. Without a doubt, due process always makes a difference, contributing distinctly and positively to employee relations-a difference that may mean getting and keeping the best employees in the years ahead. - from Amzon","Labor & Industrial Relations, Labor & Industrial Relations",,,,,,,HF5549.5.G7E95 1989

His distance from his childhood faith had become so great -- he considered himself a rational, skeptical man -- that he could not participate in this most basic ritual. Impelled by this troubling experience, Johnson began a search for the meaning of the spiritual life, a journey that took him from Gethsemani to the San Francisco Zen Center, through Buddhism and back to Christianity, from paralyzing doubt to a life-enriching faith.<BR>Keeping Faith explores the depths of what it means for a skeptic to have and to keep faith. Johnson grew up with the Trappist monks, but rejected institutionalized religion as an adult. While living as a member of the Gethsemani community and the Zen Center, however, he learned to practice Christian rituals with a new discipline and studied Buddhist meditation, which brought him a new understanding of the deep relationship between sexuality and faith, body and spirit. Changed in profound ways, Johnson ultimately turned back to his childhood faith, now inflected with the accumulated wisdom of his journey.<BR>Johnson interweaves memoir, the personal and often shocking stories of Buddhist and Christian monks, and a revealing history of the contemplative life in the West. He offers lay Christians an understanding of the origins and history of their contemplative traditions and provides the groundwork needed to challenge orthodox understandings of spirituality. No matter their backgrounds, readers will find Keeping Faith a work of great power and immediacy.</DIV> - from Amzon","Christian Living, Religious, Memoirs, Comparative Religion, Christianity, Memoirs, Comparative Religion",,,,,,,"BL73.J644A3

She acknowledges the weight and force of tradition even as she recognizes the need to reinterpret and revitalize that which she has inherited and wishes to pass on. As anyone who has ever pondered questions of the spirit can attest, there are many forms of prayer, many ways of believing. ""Kindling the Flame"" is a portrait of belief and tradition which suggests that the religion of youth can deepen in adult life, giving people of any faith a most powerful way to express their humanity. - from Amzon","Jewish, Women, Jewish Life, Women & Judaism",,,,,,,"BM726.L87

In 1980, the twenty-four-year-old graduate student Paul Romer tackled one of the oldest puzzles in economics. Eight years later he solved it. This book tells the story of what has come to be called the new growth theory: the paradox identified by Adam Smith more than two hundred years earlier, its disappearance and occasional resurfacing in the nineteenth century, the development of new technical tools in the twentieth century, and finally the student who could see further than his teachers.<br /><br /> Fascinating in its own right, new growth theory helps to explain dominant first-mover firms like IBM or Microsoft, underscores the value of intellectual property, and provides essential advice to those concerned with the expansion of the economy. Like James Gleick's <em>Chaos</em> or Brian Greene's <em>The Elegant Universe</em>, this revealing book takes us to the frontlines of scientific research; not since Robert Heilbroner's classic work <em>The Worldly Philosophers</em> have we had as attractive a glimpse of the essential science of economics. - from Amzon","Economic History, Theory, Consumer Guides",,,,,,,"HB74.8.W37,2006"

Their liturgical calendar is governed by the changing of the seasons, and by the rising and setting of the sun. Their days are spent performing a ritual of prayer and storytelling, as they knit the wool of the sheep who inhabit the monastery grounds and into whose bodies they believe their deceased sisters' souls to have entered.  Then, one day, seemingly out of nowhere, a priest appears. Hoping to rise in the church hierarchy, he has presented plans to his bishop to convert what he believes is an uninhabited and valuable piece of church property into a spa for the wealthy-and he has come to investigate the land. Father Ignatius is as surprised to see the nuns as they are to see a flesh-and-blood man, and what follows is the strange, moving, and often hilarious story of their struggle-a struggle of wills, but also of faith.  Lambs of God is a beautifully written and haunting story of colliding traditions, conflicting beliefs, and magical trans-formations. It weaves together Christian belief, classical mythology, fairy tales, Celtic lore, and the mysteries of the natural world into one of the most memorable and gripping of contemporary novels. Like Ron Hansen's Mariette in Ecstasy, Lambs of God is a wildly original investigation into the nature and complexities of faith.  - from Amzon","Contemporary, Literary, Literature & Fiction",,,,,,,PR9619.3.D382L3 1998

Americans have lived intimately with these landscapes since before recorded history, and we continue today to think about, and sometimes even struggle over, what the land means, to whom it belongs, and whose hands will shape its appearance in the future.</p> <p>In this collection of specially commissioned essays, nineteen of America's leading writers, artists, and scholars come together to ponder the question ""What is landscape?"" Recognizing that no one person or discipline can possibly provide the whole answer, George Thompson has chosen a range of viewpoints that, in his words, ""attempts to make links between art and science, history and geography, photography and literature, a land ethic and environmental design, management, and planning.""</p> <p><cite>Landscape in America</cite> is the first book to explore the idea of landscape and place in such a broad-ranging way.

Robbins has won widespread acclaim for his powerful and splendidly researched novels of World War II. Now he casts his brilliant vision on one of the most terrifying--and most crucial--battles of the war: the Battle of Kursk, Hitler’s desperate gamble to defeat Russia, in the final German offensive on the eastern front.<br><br><b>Last Citadel<br><br></b>Spring 1943. In the west, Germany strengthens its choke hold on France. To the south, an Allied invasion looms imminent. But the greatest threat to Hitler’s dream of a Thousand Year Reich lies east, where his forces are pitted in a death match with a Russian enemy willing to pay any price to defend the motherland. Hitler rolls the dice, hurling his best SS forces and his fearsome new weapon, the Mark VI Tiger tank, in a last-ditch summer offensive, code-named Citadel.<br><br>The Red Army around Kursk is a sprawling array of infantry, armor, fighter planes, and bombers. Among them is an intrepid group of women flying antiquated biplanes; they swoop over the Germans in the dark, earning their nickname, “Night Witches.” On the ground, Private Dimitri Berko gallops his tank, the Red Army’s lithe little T-34, like a Cossack steed. In the turret above Dimitri rides his son, Valya, a Communist sergeant who issues his father orders while the war widens the gulf between them. In the skies, Dimitri’s daughter, Katya, flies with the Night Witches, until she joins a ferocious band of partisans in the forests around Kursk. Like Russia itself, the Berko family is suffering the fury and devastation of history’s most titanic tank battle while fighting to preserve what is sacred–their land, their lives, and each other–as Hitler flings against them his most potent armed force.<br><br>Inexorable and devastating, a company of Mark VI Tiger tanks is commanded by one extraordinary SS officer, a Spaniard known as la Daga, the Dagger. He’d suffered a terrible wound at the hands of the Russians: now he has returned with a cold fury to exact his revenge. And above it all, one quiet man makes his own plan to bring Citadel crashing down and reshape the fate of the world.<br><br>A remarkable story of men and arms, loyalty and betrayal, <b>Last Citadel</b> propels us into the claustrophobic confines of a tank in combat, into the tension of guerrilla tactics, and across the smoking charnel of one of history’s greatest battlefields. Panoramic, authentic, and unforgettable, it reverberates long after the last cannon sounds. - from Amzon","Military, War, United States, Contemporary",,,,,,,"PS3568.02289L37

The adventures of three American students living with French families are described in three levels through “scenarios” or dialogues: the first tells the story in simple terms; the second adds more vocabulary and grammar; the third represents the kind of normal, flowing prose one encounters in reading. The scenarios invite dramatic action and a variety of applications.

It has been class-tested for raising students to an intermediate-high level of oral proficiency in a traditional or accelerated course, or to the advanced level in an immersion environment. To expand possibilities in communicative and cultural competency, the instructor can select from a variety of new presentations and activities while maintaining the integrity of each lesson.<br><br>The Fourth Edition will continue to serve traditional and accelerated language programs both in two- and four-year colleges and universities, and in two-year high school language programs.

The leadership practices of the individuals featured contribute significantly to craft knowledge and to the discourse on contemporary issues of educational leadership. These leaders develop collaborative decision-making processes, push the bureaucratic boundaries, claim power through politics, and live and lead from values. The authors contend that the leadership practices depicted reflect a redefinition of leadership that emanates from a constructive postmodern paradigm aimed at social reconstruction. These leaders are redefining leadership by integrating doing and being. <br /><br />This book is a report of the results of a collective qualitative inquiry into the leadership of eighteen impressive women educational leaders from Illinois, representing a diversity of roles, community sizes, institutional types, and racial perspectives. The chapters intertwine personal stories with the scholarship about leadership. No pseudonyms are used. Although several recent books have been published about the experiences of women as leaders, leadership studies have generally not included women or failed to point to women leaders as role models who could, even should, be emulated by leaders of both genders. It is past time to close the gender leadership gap in educational administration. This book will contribute to the ongoing redefinition of leadership and perhaps after reading this book leaders who dare will move themselves and our culture closer to gender inclusive perceptions of what leadership is and who leaders are. - from Amzon","Educators, Administration, Philosophy & Social Aspects, Reform & Policy, Specialty Boutique, Educators, Administration, Leadership, Philosophy & Social Aspects, Education Policy & Reform, Policy",,,,,,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gHTuAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,LB2831.624I4L96

As O'Toole brilliantly demonstrates, values-based leadership is not only fair and just, it is also highly effective in today's complex organizations.<br>When leaders truly believe that their prime goal is the welfare of their followers, they get results. The finest leaders--from political giants like Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln to contemporary CEOs like Max De Pree and James Houghton--have always shared leadership with their followers. They create organizations that encourage change and self-reevaluation; they foster an atmosphere of open-mindedness and fresh thinking, in which assumptions can be challenged and goals reassessed. <br>Grounded in the ideas of moral philosophy, Leading Change powerfully transcends the standard how-to management primer to define a challenging new approach to leadership. As O'Toole so persuasively argues, growth and change are possible, indeed necessary, and they will be effected by individuals who have the stature and the courage to lead morally. This important book, at once thought-provoking and totally practical, is bound to take its place as one of the landmark business volumes of our times.<br>""Jim O'Toole has written the essential work for organizations to survive and thrive in today's changing world. His intellectually penetrating thinking shows us how the sometimes conflicting problems we wrestle with--often in piecemeal fashion--fit together to form a complete picture, even as the picture itself continues to change. His message is so critical to the very existence of every organization that any leader who fails to heed his advice condemns his or her company to mediocrity and/or early death.

Michael Fullan--an internationally acclaimed expert in organizational change--shows how leaders in all types of organizations can accomplish their goals and become exceptional leaders.

As reflected in the new title, Learning Disabilities and Related Mild Disabilities now includes a cross-categorical emphasis, making it suitable to a broader number of courses. Specifically, the text now accommodates the increased number of courses aimed at teaching students with mild disabilities that are part of many states' certification requirements. Researchers are finding that many students with learning disabilities exhibit coexisting related disorders such as ADHD, Asperger's Syndrome, and nonverbal learning disabilities. Preservice and in-service classroom teachers, who are increasingly responsible for teaching students with special needs within general education or inclusive classrooms, will find this new edition especially helpful. The text describes the characteristics of various mild disabilities and offers teaching strategies for general education teachers, special education teachers, school psychologists, and other related professionals.

Our children lag behind students in other countries--and they are losing ground. In The Learning Gap, Harold W. Stevenson and James W. Stigler put this crisis in perspective by comparing teachers, parents, children, schools, and educational practices in the United States, Japan, Taiwan, and China. Based on five major studies, funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation and featured on the front page of The New York Times, this is the first comprehensive account of what works in elementary education and what doesn't--and why. The authors analyze the role of standardized tests, tracking, special education, class size, money, classroom discipline, textbooks, and parental involvement and arrive at some startling conclusions that will drastically alter our understanding of the problems and possibilities of our schools. Television is not to blame for children's poor performance nor are underpaid or poorly trained teachers. And contrary to prevailing opinion, class size should be increased, and children should not begin academic preparation in preschool and kindergarten. Most important, the authors show that parental involvement is critical to children's learning and that schools should reward individual effort rather than emphasize innate ability. Bringing a clarity of purpose to the debate on education that is missing from the schools themselves, The Learning Gap is a landmark study that will shape the educational agenda of the future. - from Amzon","Education Theory, Early Childhood Education, Elementary Education",,,,,,,"LA219.S76

Indeed, as Dr. Charles Jonkel, dean of American bear researchers, says: ""Bears have better senses than we do and they know their environment better than we do. If we only knew how many thousands of times each year they take care of us ... and we don't even know they're around."" Yet every year, humans are slain by bears, and bears killed by humans. Why? Dr. Jonkel says there are two reasons: ""1) We simply don't know bear etiquette and 2) Our rules are too inconsistent for bears to understand."" Research utilizing radio telemetry seems to support Jonkels theory--that in some places, bears really are trying to get along in order to go along. And that many of their human neighbors are rallying to the animals' support. In some cases, study bears have been closely monitored for years, with hundreds of location fixes identified via radio transmitters attached to the beasts. Discoveries include mammoth grizazlies amid densely populated areas, without their human neighbors being the wiser. In other cases the bears appear to be indifferent to humans: sows and cubs feeding on lawn clover while subdivision home owners shoot video footage through their living room windows. This book, Learning to Talk Bear, documents all the above and more utilizing biological research, and mixing the experiences of veteran outdoorsman-journalist Roland Cheek. The author uses trademark with and humor to both entertain and teach about a mostly unknown side of the most powerful carnivores on earth, demonstrating an advanced understanding of bear etiquette and a clear willingness to travel and recreate within the great beasts' living room, following rules they, too, can understand. - from Amzon","Bears, Animal Behavior & Communication, Reference",,,,,,,"QL737.C37C44

The editors, D.

Loewen,,,,Simon & Schuster,1,1996,,,,,NON FICTION,,Book,"<P> <b>Winner of the 1996 American Book Award and the Oliver Cromwell Cox Award for Distinguished Anti-Racist Scholarship</b> <P> Americans have lost touch with their history, and in this thought-provoking book, Professor James Loewen shows why. After surveying twelve leading high school American history texts, he has concluded that <I>not one</I> does a decent job of making history interesting or memorable. Marred by an embarrassing combination of blind patriotism, mindless optimism, sheer misinformation, and outright lies, these books omit almost all the ambiguity, passion, conflict, and drama from our past. In ten powerful chapters, Loewen reveals that: <P> <ul> <li>The United States dropped three times as many tons of explosives in Vietman as it dropped in all theaters of World War II, including Hiroshima and Nagasaki</li> <li>Ponce de Leon went to Florida mainly to capture Native Americans as slaves for Hispaniola, not to find the mythical fountain of youth <li>Woodrow Wilson, known as a progressive leader, was in fact a white supremacist who personally vetoed a clause on racial equality in the Covenant of the League of Nations</li> <li>The first colony to legalize slavery was not Virginia but Massachusetts</li> </ul> <P> From the truth about Columbus's historic voyages to an honest evaluation of our national leaders, Loewen revives our history, restoring to it the vitality and relevance it truly possesses. - from Amzon","United States, Historiography, Study & Teaching, Reference, Schools & Teaching, Education, Europe, United States",,,,,,,E175.85.L64 1996

Crowded together with students for six or more hours a day in a space no bigger than a large living room, the immediate response of most teachers is to maintain control and enforce obedience. But creating a community - bringing students together and keeping them together - is the most vital aspect of a teacher's work. Without it, real learning cannot take place, as even the soundest philosophies and techniques amount to little without a community to bring them to life. The concept of community in the classroom is certainly not new, but little has been said about what makes up a community, how it is created, and what functions it fulfills. <P>In <I>Life in a Crowded Place</I>, Ralph Peterson helps teachers see what it is they do when they bring students together to make a community. The hope here is to show teachers what is going on - to identify and name - so that they can exercise greater control over their work and understand the kind of learning community they are making (or need to make) and how that community functions to influence the quality of learning and life in elementary and middle school. <P>Readers of this book will: </P> <UL> <LI>acquire language for identifying and understanding the community-making aspect of their work </LI> <LI>identify ways they can work with their students to make a learning community</LI> <LI>initiate teaching and learning that is centered in critique and dialogue</LI> <LI>gain an understanding of the importance of the social in learning and the benefit of community. </LI> </UL> - from Amzon","Children's Books, Experimental Methods, Instruction Methods, Certification & Development, Elementary Education",,,,,,,LB1032.P48 1992

Between production (power plants) and delivery is an antiquated, ""third-world"" transmission grid that is in desperate need of hardening against breakdowns, terrorist attacks, inadequate carrying capacity, and operational obsolescence. And while electricity doesn't hold the headlines or dramatic power of oil, the ability to ensure its uninterrupted supply at a reasonable price is even more essential to global survival and prosperity. Lights Out is today's most detailed, in-depth examination of this largely unreported looming energy crisis. Written by one of the world's top electricity industry experts, this powerful book covers numerous hot button economic and political issues-free markets versus regulation; energy independence versus foreign imports; nuclear power, global warming, and other environmental issues; and much more. Beyond just uncovering and illuminating the problems, however, it proposes a comprehensive road map of technical solutions and regulatory reform from both the production and demand sides of the equation-a framework for rethinking, rebuilding, and enhancing the entire electricity production and delivery infrastructure. Prescriptive and provocative, Lights Out will redefine the simmering debate on how the world can-and must-act now to head off a global catastrophe, one that could eventually wreak even more havoc than the ongoing oil crisis.</p> <p><b>Jason Makansi</b> is the President of Pearl Street, Inc., a consulting firm; Principal of PS Liquidity Advisors, an advisory service for energy technology companies raising capital; and Executive Director of the Energy Storage Council, a public-policy advocacy organization.
